During our day in Rhodes, we arranged a private tour with Nicholas, and it exceeded all expectations. Nicholas greeted us at the port alongside our driver, Kostas, who proved to be both knowledgeable and amiable throughout the day. Our teenagers, aged 17 and 15, particularly enjoyed Kostas' company, and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this private tour to fellow travelers. **Amanda and Family (March 11th) Cambridge, Ontario, Canada**

Hey Nick, spending time with Manuel felt like being with a long-time friend. It was an incredibly enjoyable, and enlightening day during which we felt like we had known him for years.

Nicholas, we want to express our gratitude for the fantastic experience we had with Michael. His wealth of knowledge and informative insights truly enriched our time exploring this stunning island. One of the highlights was the lunch break at a traditional tavern, where we had authentic local cuisine. We recommend Michael for an unforgettable experience. **Nancy and Jim W.

During our day in Rhodes, we arranged a private tour with Nicholas, and it exceeded all expectations. Nicholas greeted us at the port alongside our driver, Kostas, who proved to be both knowledgeable and amiable throughout the day. Our teenagers, aged 17 and 15, particularly enjoyed Kostas' company, and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this private tour to fellow travelers. **Amanda and Family (March 11th) Cambridge, Ontario, Canada**

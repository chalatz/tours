HI NICK SURE WAS GREAT TO MEET YOU, LEARN ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND RHODES. WE HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME WITH YOU AND WERE VERY HAPPY WITH ALL THE INFORMATION YOU GAVE ABOUT YOUR BEAUTIFUL ISLAND. YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF IT.<br>
THANKS AGAIN<br>

Dear Nick, We had a chance to tour the Island with you on both East and West Coasts, and have great time.<br>
Coming back I looked at your web site. I hope your business approach works well.<br>
With the best wishes to you and your cosmopolitan family, Yuri<br>

My wife, Nancy, and I spent a couple of hours with Nicholas last September.We had a wonderful time, got lots of information on Rhodes. He knows the Island of Rhodes as well as how life in Rhodes is today.<br>
Nicholas speaks 5 or 6 languages and is very easy to listen to. He was in no rush, but ready to move on when we were. I think he made our stop there wonderful instead of just nice. I would not hesitate to recommend him as a private tour.<br>

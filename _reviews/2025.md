Hi Nicholas, Thank you for a great day in Rhodes! Your prompt and helpful responses to my questions, as well as your flexibility with our requested changes, were truly appreciated. Michael was absolutely fantastic, his conversations with us about the islandâ€™s natural beauty, rich history, and just the right touch of current Greek life were captivating. Iâ€™ll be posting this on TripAdvisor to help other travelers discover your company. Best regards **Kristin W. and Family.(March 12th) Charleston, SC, USA**  

Nicholas thank you. We had a fantastic day with Yannis and truly enjoyed every moment of our tour. Everything was wonderful, and we appreciate the warm hospitality. We hope to return again in the future for another amazing experience! Take care and best wishes. **Abbey C.and Family ðŸ˜Š(Feb 22nd) Denver, CO, USA**

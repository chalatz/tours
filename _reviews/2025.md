Hi Nicholas, we had a great full day tour and saw all the sights. Giannis (John) provided a wealth of information as we visited the different sites across the island. Thanks! **Debbie M. (QAug 22nd) Delray Beach, Florida, USA**

Thanks Nicholas, the tour with Kostas was fantastic. Our time in Rhodes this time was spent with my Sister and Brother In-Law (both of whom had never been to Rhodes before.) We were conscious that we wanted to show them some of the great sights in Rhodes whilst also seeing some new ones ourselves. And that is exactly what we got. Kostas was amazing. His historical knowledge was second to none and he went into detail but kept it very interesting. He really added a lot to the whole tour.  I can't recommend your tours highly enough and tell everyone about them! Keep well - and hope to see you all soon. Regards, **Keith W. and Family (15th Aug) U.K**

Nicholas, Thanks for taking such good care of my girls.  They really enjoyed the tour.  Hope to have another opportunity to tour with you in the future.  **Chris R.(Aug 10th)  Ellijay, Georgia, USA** 

Thank you so much, Nicholas. It was truly a perfect excursion. From the driver, with his excellent attitude and willingness to help us with everything, taking care of every detail, to Yannis, who explained everything so wonderfully and was so kind that he felt like part of our family. We are truly very grateful, and if we come back, we’ll definitely contact you again and recommend you to our friends. Please send our regards and thanks once again to Yannis and Kostas. **Flor and Family (8th Aug) Spaine**

Nicholas, Cristo was amazing and this is definitely one island we'd love to come back to one day. I know a few people who may be considering Greek Isles cruises in the future. If Rhodes is a stop, I'll recommend your company for sure. I will also leave a very positive review on Viator, once I am back on land. Regards **Jean Francois B.(Aug 4th) Otava, Ontario, Canada**  

Nicholas, we had a great time on the tour! Teo was a great tour-driver! Thank you for the great tour and we will recommend your company for those booking tours in Rhodes! Warm regards, **Teri and Ray S (Aug 3rd) Alburtis, PA, USA**

Thank you Nicholas, and thank you George for doing a great job taking us around the island. Much appreciated! **Linda Z. and Family (July 27th) New York, USA**

Thank you so much for our tour. We really enjoyed ourselves and Kostas was an excellent guide fountain of knowledge. We would definitely recommend to our friends.  Thanks again
**Claudia B.and family (18 July) Glasgow, Scotland**

Nicholas, we thank you too! I was about to send you a note. All the adults enjoyed the tour very much. In a few days we will find out how much the kids took in (learned). I was happy that they were at least exposed to the history of Rhodes and their culture.  Kostas is a great tour guide and very knowledgeable. He was also great with the children. We will want him again to be our tour guide next time we come to Rhodes. Thanks again, **Popi Fine and Family (July 12th) Boston, Massachusetts, USA**

On behalf of all of us Thank you Nicholas, we very much enjoyed the tour and Christos was great. He was very pleasant and informative. Rhodes is a beautiful island, much nicer than Crete or Santorini. Arrivederci, **John and Group (July 9th) Montreal, Quebec, Canada**

Nicholas thank you for this awesome tour! Anastasia was a fantastic guide, and I highly recommend her. She is very knowledgeable and interesting, and she taught me so much about Rhodes history, culture, and philosophy! She was welcoming to my questions and consistently kept my interest with her responses and commentary on each location we visited, as well as some that I’ll see in upcoming days! She also speaks outstanding English and taught me some new words in Greek and gave me info on Greek ideas that I was curious about. 
Giorgios was an excellent driver, and I felt well taken care of throughout the tour. He drove safely and confidently down narrow and tough streets … and was kind enough to offer cold water on a very hot day!  Thank you! **Best, Meredith K.(July 3rd)  Millbrae, California, USA**

We had a wonderful day in Rhodes! Kostas was so knowledgeable about this beautiful island. The stops he shared with us will hold special memories. Thank you for this lovely day! **Alexander H.(June 27th) Jackson,Michigan,USA**

Hi Nicholas, we had a great time!! Thank you for sharing your beautiful island with us! **Kim B. and Family (June 25th) Naperville,IL,USA**

Dear Nicholas, thank you for making our visit to your beautiful island so special and memorable. Please send many thanks to Anastasia, who was nothing short of fantastic and to lovely George.  You have a team to be proud of. We shall be back.  Best regards **Sharon K.(19th June) London. UK**

Thank you, Nicholas, we had a great time with Kostas.  Will leave you a review on Viator, when I get home.  All the best. **Keri S. and Family (June 17th) New Ohio, USA**

Nicholas, thank you so much. We enjoyed our tour visiting your beautiful Island and enjoyed our time with Teo. Best regards to all of you! **Aldo and Domenica M. (June 14th) Canada**

My family and I can’t thank you enough, especially George, for the wonderful tour we had. Every one of us loved it, and George took great care of all our needs. We’ll definitely try to come back to this beautiful island! Thanks again, we’ll stay in touch and will definitely recommend you.  **Ximena C. and Family (June 11th) Santiago, Las Condes, Chile**

Nicholas thank you! We had a lovely trip. I would like to do the tour in the future if we return with our other side of the family. We wanted to leave good reviews about the tour. Just to confirm, our driver today was George? The driver was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and did a wonderful job. We couldn’t have been happier. Thanks, **Jen & Brett (June 5th) Charleston,SC,US**

Dear Nicholas and Giannis, Thank you so much for your thoughtful message! It was truly a pleasure touring with you. I deeply appreciated the warm hospitality, local insights, and the seamless experience you provided throughout our visit to Rhodes.  Giannis was not only an excellent driver but also a fantastic guide who brought the island to life with every story and suggestion. We’ve returned with beautiful memories, from the medieval charm of the Acropolis to the stunning coastline, and we’re already thinking about our next visit!  Please extend my gratitude to everyone on your team. I’ll be sure to recommend your services to any friends or colleagues heading your way. Wishing you continued success, and I hope our paths cross again soon. Warm regards, **Chiu (June 2nd) Taiwan**

Dear Nicholas, thank you so much for a great day on your beautiful island! George was a wonderful guide! He gave us a great guided tour, taught us so much about Rhodes and the areas we visited, was so accommodating to our questions and requests. He is a gem of a guide. And special thanks to you for staying in touch and helping me plan our tour with you! Warmest regards and we will definitely reach out to you when we are able to come back!  **Nancy and Steve A.(April 4th) Seattle,WA,USA**

Hi Nicholas, Thank you for a great day in Rhodes! Your prompt and helpful responses to my questions, as well as your flexibility with our requested changes, were truly appreciated. Michael was absolutely fantastic, his conversations with us about the islandâ€™s natural beauty, rich history, and just the right touch of current Greek life were captivating. Iâ€™ll be posting this on TripAdvisor to help other travelers discover your company. Best regards **Kristin W. and Family.(March 12th) Charleston, SC, USA**

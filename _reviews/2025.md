Nicholas thank you. We had a fantastic day with Yannis and truly enjoyed every moment of our tour. Everything was wonderful, and we appreciate the warm hospitality. We hope to return again in the future for another amazing experience! Take care and best wishes. **Abbey C.and Family ðŸ˜Š(Feb 22nd) Denver, CO, USA**

Thank you so much Nick, we truly enjoyed our tour of Rhodes, and we were pleased with our driver Michael. He was friendly and knowledgeable and gave us a great experience of the island. We look forward to visiting Rhodes again when possible. Cheers, **Brenda O. (Jan 20th) Ontario, Canada**

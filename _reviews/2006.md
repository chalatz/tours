Nick,<br>
First and foremost thank you for the wonderful 1/2 day tour of Rhodes. From beginning to end, you made sure that we did not miss a thing. We are eternally grateful for that. Your insight and patience was well appreciated. We also appreciated you going out of your way to get us some delicious "baklava" and "galaktoboureko". Rhodes was one of the highlights of our cruise trip, all thanks to you. We hope to visit again soon. If we do, know that you will be the first person we call. I will certainly recommend you to all of my friends.<br>
Thanks again.<br>

Hi Michael, We would like to send a special thank you to you and your brother Nicholas. We have had a great day out with you today. We saw so much with you that we probably would not have seen if we didn't do this tour with you. Mihalis my husband was born in Greece and has commented on how much knowledge you know of the island. We would recommend this tour to all our family back home in Australia. Thank you for taking us to where we wanted to go. Don't think any other tour would have done this much for us. Again thank you for a very very nice and relaxed day.<br>

Bonjour, nous sommes bien rentrés chez nous.<br>
Nous avons apprécié notre sejour dans votre belle île et votre chauffeur a été parfait: il nous a bien expliqué tout ce que voyions et malgré les ambarras de circulation à cause des files dans les stations essence nous a bien conduit en temps et en heure partout où nous devions et voulions aller. Il a su nous faire apprécier de très beaux endroits.<br>
Nous recommanderons vos services à d'autres personnes sans problème.<br>
Peut être à une prochaine fois<br>

Hi Nick; To say we had an awesome time is a under statement. Thank you so much for all of your time and knowledge. We are talking about coming back to Rhodes again next year for a couple of days. Your island is beautiful and we want to explore it more. We also want to spend some time at St Paul's Bay. The restaurant that you took us to was wonderful, and swimming right there after we ate was a treat. You were wonderful. We look forward to seeing you again.<br>
Thank you once again<br>

Hello, We all enjoyed Rhodes, it will be among our favorites to visit if we are ever so lucky to return to the Greek Isles. Our driver Manuel was wonderful and we had lunch at a very nice place, it was all perfect. Booking anything through the internet is always a risk but in this case we were fortunate indeed to use your taxi service. I was so impressed with all the olive tree's and there beautiful silvery leaves and how our driver has had his tree's in his family for years, that I hope to grow my own olive tree. Not a grove of them but at least try to have one on my patio in Florida.<br>
Thank you once again,<br>

Hello Nicholas<br>
We have just got back to New Zealand yesterday and had a wonderful trip. One of the highlight was of course our day in Rhodes with you - and thank you for taking us to Lindos and the restaurant - that too was a great choice.<br>
My brother and his wife will be going on an identical cruise in September and I have passed your information on to them. We shall certainly hope to return to Rhodes again and use your services again.<br>

Thanks, Nicholas. We very much enjoyed our trip to Rhodes and you were a large part of it. In fact, it was one of our favorite stops on the cruise. The rest of the trip went very well. My boss and her sister are going to Greece in November/December. I am not sure if she is going to Rhodes but if so, she will know who to call!<br>
Take care.<br>

My group of 3 persons spent a day & a half in Rhodes June 7 & 8, 2010. Nicholas, provided us with our transfer from the airport to the hotel. He was very polite & personable. He delivered us as close as he could to our hotel in Old Town & helped us carry our bags. He was wonderful! The next day we went on the full day tour of Rhodes. Nicholas was very knowledgeable and patient, never rushing us as we were sightseeing. He also took us to a nice restaurant for lunch!! He was the best tour driver I have ever dealt with!!! I highly recommmend touring with Nicholas. We had only one full day in Rhodes and he made sure we saw the best of it!!! After the tour he dropped us off at the port. Nicholas, Thank you for such a wonderful experience in Rhodes!<br>
Keep up the good work!<br>

Hi Nicholas. Just a brief note to thank you, and specially Michael, for the excellent service we had in our tour, with his knowledge. We really enjoy it, and will recommend you. Not everybody is willing to take an individual tour, and prefer the cruise tours, but for those willing to do it, this one really works.<br>

Hi Nicholas, We both enjoyed our trip to Rhodes. We would love to return for a longer stay although at this stage I don't know when that may be. We both have been telling our friends that the private excursion is the way to go. It is more relaxing and can be modified if there is something one wants to do or doesn't want to do.<br>
All the best,<br>

Hello Nick: Michael and I just wanted to thank you for an amazing tour of Rhodes. We decided it was our favorite spot in Greece and your tour to both sides of the Island, the wine region and historic sights made our visit very special. We especially enjoyed our wine tasting at the small, family wineries and at the general wine tasting facility in the wine area. It provided such a great opportunity to taste a variety of interesting and good local wines. As we mentioned, we have friends coming to the area in middle June and we will definitely recommend your services. I'm not sure what their plans are but we will certainly encourage them to use your firm. The professionalism of your firm was greatly appreciated, especially your prompt and complete replies to our emails as we began planning our trip.<br>
Again, our thanks.<br>
Warm regards,<br>
Bobbie and Michael<br>
metzgerb@earthlink.netHonest. Reliable. Knowledgeable. Trustworthy. These are just a few of the words I can use to express my feelings towards Nick and his very professional team. We arrived to Rhodes during an extremely busy period with over 7,000 people traveling to the island. Despite this chaos, Nick and his team showed us and our guests a fantastic and highly enjoyable time. We toured the island, leisurely and Nick never missed a photo opportunity or chance to share an extra special tid-bit of information regarding the island. He made sure we maximized our time in all of the "right" places and his recommendations for restaurants were BEYOND perfect. I commend Nick for a job well done and thank him personally for going above and beyond any expectation that I had of a "city tour". Thanks again, Nick!!!!<br>

We have just returned from our big adventure and I must say you made part of it very nice. We so enjoyed spending the day with you on Rhodes. It was one of our best ports of the cruise. It was nice to visit the restaurant where the owners wife was from the states. What a nice man he was to sit with us and talk about home. Thank you for all the information you provided and I will definitely recommend you to my friends and family. Thanks again<br>

My wife and I just wanted to say thank you for the wonderful tour we had with Michael on September 21 2006. The professionalism of your services and thoroughness of showing us around Rhodes was exceptional. Michael was very knowledgeable and made us feel very relaxed in allowing us to taylor the tour to just what we wanted to see. The valley of the butterflies was a once in a life time trip. Michael also gave us some great tips on Greek food<br>
It was the best way to start off our introduction of Rhodes. Efharisto! Again, Thank you.<br>

Hello: We are back at home and busy as ever... but we had the most wonderful time in Rhodes. You and your brother did so much to make our trip fun and easy... From meeting us at the airport to our tour on Wednesday. You knowledge of the country and your personal experiences helped make it a great day and we saw so much we would never have been able to see on our own. All I can say is that it was like visiting family and friends instead of just being tourist in Greece.We would love to go back and visit again...So thank you so much. You have a wonderful Island and you are great people!<br>

Hi Nicholas, We loved Rhodes and Michael did a wonderful job driving and showing us around the wonderful sites of ancient Rhodes, as well as Lindos. The drive to Lindos was lovely and Michael was very helpful. We certainly recommend your services to anyone going to Rhodes. We also loved the little restaurant he took us to on the beach at Lindos. It was so relaxing to look at the beautiful water and to walk on the beach.<br>

Honest. Reliable. Knowledgeable. Trustworthy. These are just a few of the words I can use to express my feelings towards Nick and his very professional team. We arrived to Rhodes during an extremely busy period with over 7,000 people traveling to the island. Despite this chaos, Nick and his team showed us and our guests a fantastic and highly enjoyable time. We toured the island, leisurely and Nick never missed a photo opportunity or chance to share an extra special tid-bit of information regarding the island. He made sure we maximized our time in all of the "right" places and his recommendations for restaurants were BEYOND perfect. I commend Nick for a job well done and thank him personally for going above and beyond any expectation that I had of a "city tour". Thanks again, Nick!!!!<br>

We have just returned from our big adventure and I must say you made part of it very nice. We so enjoyed spending the day with you on Rhodes. It was one of our best ports of the cruise. It was nice to visit the restaurant where the owners wife was from the states. What a nice man he was to sit with us and talk about home. Thank you for all the information you provided and I will definitely recommend you to my friends and family. Thanks again<br>

My wife and I just wanted to say thank you for the wonderful tour we had with Michael on September 21 2006. The professionalism of your services and thoroughness of showing us around Rhodes was exceptional. Michael was very knowledgeable and made us feel very relaxed in allowing us to taylor the tour to just what we wanted to see. The valley of the butterflies was a once in a life time trip. Michael also gave us some great tips on Greek food<br>
It was the best way to start off our introduction of Rhodes. Efharisto! Again, Thank you.<br>

Hello: We are back at home and busy as ever... but we had the most wonderful time in Rhodes. You and your brother did so much to make our trip fun and easy... From meeting us at the airport to our tour on Wednesday. You knowledge of the country and your personal experiences helped make it a great day and we saw so much we would never have been able to see on our own. All I can say is that it was like visiting family and friends instead of just being tourist in Greece.We would love to go back and visit again...So thank you so much. You have a wonderful Island and you are great people!<br>

Hi Nick, it took us a while to adjust to the time change and real life again. We enjoyed Rhodes very much and you and Michael did a great job. We need to try and remember all the history and my photos (which came out great). Take care and enjoy being Mr. Mom during the off season.<br>

Hello to you, Nickolas and Michael,<br>
Yes, we had a wonderful, wonderful vacation. We will always remember you two and your kindness and thoughtfulness. We had the best time "touring" with you. You showed us so many wonderful places and things that we would never have done on our own and we learned so much about Rhodes from you.We loved Rhodes. It was one of our favorite places. We will always remember the beautiful countryside, the blue sea, the smell of the air. We hope you are both well, that the twins are doing well and that your families are well. Thank you again for showing us such a fabulous time. We miss you and Greece.<br>

Hi Nicholas, We loved Rhodes and Michael did a wonderful job driving and showing us around the wonderful sites of ancient Rhodes, as well as Lindos. The drive to Lindos was lovely and Michael was very helpful. We certainly recommend your services to anyone going to Rhodes. We also loved the little restaurant he took us to on the beach at Lindos. It was so relaxing to look at the beautiful water and to walk on the beach.<br>
Thank you. Best wishes, Nancy and Greg M., Atlanta/Marietta, GA<br>

Dear Nickolas: We had a wonderful vacation in Greece. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Rhodes, and your service was the reason why the trip was so memorable. As we told you previously, my family thought that you were the best driver that we have ever had. We have been on a number of private day trips in Greece, as well as in other parts of the world, and your service stand out from all the others. Your knowledge of the island, and its geography was extensive, and you were able to convey all this information in an exciting way. You were accommodating to our schedule and our interests and we want to thank you for a memorable trip. We will highly recommend you to our friends and family when they visit Rhodes.<br>

Hi Nick. Just thought you would like to know that I have included your service and email on the Net so that everyone can have the wonderful experience we had with your company. Here is a portion of my "review" of our cruise that I just uploaded: Rhodes...TIPS: Yes, you can take a tour of Lindos, which is a small town with two beautiful harbors .....We took this "tour" with a wonderful driver, he was funny, knew everything about the island and showed us the sights in an air-conditioned Mercedes. He was one of the highlights of the cruise.<br>
I have now looked at your web site--nice work!<br>
Thanks again for making our trip so wonderful!<br>

Dear Nicholas. I am Omar the son of Dr Monir . We visited Rhodes last month on the cruise ship Boccacio<br>
We took a tour to Lindos and Faliraki with your company. I want you to know that Rodos was one of the best islands I have seen in my life and we all enjoyed your excellent service. Our driver had a great sense of humor!. I hope to visit Rodos again next year.<br>
Thank you for the tour!<br>

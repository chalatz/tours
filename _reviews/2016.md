Dear Nicholas, It has been over a month since we enjoyed our wonderful visit with you and Michael in Rhodes. It was a great tour we will never forget and continue to talk about with our friends! We look forward to visiting Rhodes again and will certainly have you (or Michael) show us around your beautiful island again.<br>
Have a wonderful Christmas, Doug and Lisee M. (Dec 16th) Kansas City, Missouri

WOW.. Nicholas this was a great day and trip. I cant thank you enough for the great day and we will share your services with our team.<br>
The Travel Collaborative, Branch of the Tzell Travel Group, Scott G (Dec10th) CAMBRIDGE, MA

Our group of 3 people was met promptly at the cruise terminal, introduced to our tour/driver Stamos and left for a very fabulous day. Stamos went above and beyond to drive us to the highlights of the area and knew how to avoid the big crowds. He is extremely well informed, very professional and thoroughly enjoyable. In addition to our wonderful tour and amazing local lunch, he found time to allow me to stop and purchase some truly local olives. What an amazing day! Nicholas, please thank Stamos for an absolutely wonderful day.<br>
Amanda M (Nov12th) Ontario, Toronto

Dear Nicholas, We do indeed have very fond memories from our day on Rhodes. Manuel was a wonderful guide, helpful in all sorts of ways--not least dealing with a delay when my wife and I took the wrong route coming down from the Lindos acropolis! It was a pleasure spending the day with him.<br>

Dear Nicholas, We are back in rainy England following our wonderful holiday in Rhodes. Although our main aim was to have some sunshine and relaxation, we just wanted to thank you very much indeed for the brilliant half day tour you took us on. We thoroughly enjoyed it and particularly liked the fact that you managed to enable us to see so much in such a short time frame. Your local knowledge of the area enabled us to see things that we would otherwise have taken hours to find and we particularly enjoyed your "mini-history" lesson and all of the interesting information you shared with us. We will definitely recommend you to others as being the most enjoyable way to explore the island. Your air conditioned Mercedes was also very much appreciated and offered some respite from the heat! We have some wonderful memories to look back on from all the photos you took of us whilst on the tour -- many thanks again and we hope to see you again in the future.<br>

Rhodes was the 6th stop on our cruise. We used Rhodes Private Tours. They gave us a 4 ½ hour tour (we actually extended it an additional hour).The tour/driver Dominic never stopped talking about this beautiful island and we were so impressed with all the information he gave us. I heartily recommend this service. We saw so much more than we would have on a bus. I would use them again if I ever get back to Rhodes.<br>

Nicholas, Our tour of Rhodes was fantastic mainly because of our driver Manuel. He was the best guide we had on our entire trip, and we took over 12 shore excursions on our trip. My wife thought Greece was the best country we visited, and we visited nine other countries. I am sure she felt that way primarily because of Manuel. We enjoyed every sight he brought us to. I hope someday we have the opportunity to revisit Greece.<br>
Thanks again for all your efforts.<br>

Nicholas, We have only just arrived home after a wonderful and very memorable trip throughout Italy, and the many ship excursions to Turkey, Sicily and some of the many islands of Greece....Rhodes being most memorable. Dominic (Kiriakos)) was such an excellent tour/driver whom we all enjoyed immensely.<br>
It was very nice to meet you...brief as it was. Thank you for asking Dominic to stop by. We will not hesitate to recommend "Rhodes Private Tours" to any of our family and friends that may travel to Rhodes in the future. Warmest regards. Please pass on our regards to Dominic<br>

Many thanks Nick, we did enjoy our day with you and feel that we saw more of the island than we would have done off the ship.<br>
However, the stop for lunch at Elena's was a definite highlight and we were really pleased you took us there.<br>
We would definitely recommend to our friends.<br>
Kind regards<br>

Dear Nicholas, We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and the highlight was definitely our tour of Rhodes with Sergio. I highly recommend your service to anyone who wants an in-depth and pleasurable tour of Rhodes at an extremely reasonable cost. Also, many thanks to Sergio for recommending a restaurant for lunch after our tour. It was excellent. Wishing you and your families all the best for the upcoming holiday season and for a healthy, happy, and prosperous New Year. Anne anne.beirne@gmail.com (Nov 30th)

Thank you, Nicholas! We enjoyed the rest of our trip and arrived home on Sunday. We all still say the best tour day on our cruise was Rhodes. Thank you for your help in making it a memorable time! I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and that you and your family will have a prosperous new year!<br>
Thanks again! Tara, Erik, Maya & Kieran princesswahooey@hotmail.com (Nov 30th)

Hello Nicholas. Thank you for the wonderful tour of your home island. It is a lovely place with such beautiful scenery. I do wish we could have visited on a day that the major sights were open but I will be sure to do that next time!<br>

Nicholas. Our day with Dominic was one of the best days we have had since leaving Australia over a month ago. He was very knowledgable but also very funny. Dominic told us more than just the usual tourist info he also shared with us family and philosophical ideas and at all times his enthusiasm for the future of Greece.<br>
Debra Eustace DEBRA.EUSTACE@det.nsw.edu.au (Oct 13th)

Nicholas, I can't thank you enough for the special tour with Anthony yesterday. Anthony was a marvelous driver. I am recommending him, and your services, to our travel agent, to our friends, and also on Cruise Critic. What a gem you have on your team!<br>
Rhodes delighted us with it's beauty, it's history, its for its culture and friendly citizens. I can recommend Anthony without reservation to anyone in Rhodes who wishes to have a first class experience.<br>
Best regards,<br>

Hello Nicholas!! We enjoyed your tour vey much, so much so, that we spent too much time eating @ that fabulous restaurant (would you send name?) that we were unable to see more of your beautiful island. I guess that gives us good reason to come back !? Thank You so much for your kindness & sense of humor ! I wish you much success.<br>
Best regards to you & your family<br>
Sincerely,<br>

Dear Nicholas<br>
You live in a beautiful country and we enjoyed our day with you. Nicholas, you are very professional and it was a pleasure working with you. I found you through the internet and was not in any way disappointed with you or your knowledgeable drivers - to the contrary, we were quite impressed. We appreciated that you met us at the dock and then found us again in Lindos and we have a picture to prove it.<br>
It will be our pleasure to recommend you to our friends should they travel to Rhodes.<br>
I wish you health and success. (Sept 21st)<br>

Dear Nicholas, (August 18th)<br>
Thank you so much for the wonderful day with you discovering Rhodes.The best thing about having a local person is that you really get to talk and learn about your life and your views, not just someone pointing out sites. This is how real communication works between people of different countries...not the media! Take away all the preconceptions and we are all people wanting a good life for our familes and to enjoy this beautiful earth.<br>
And what a treasure Argos was,a perfectly beautiful place for lunch away from all the "tourists" (like me).Delicious<br>
Sincerely,<br>

Hey Sergio and Nick,<br>
We got back late due to the tropical storm in the Gulf. It has been crazy! In short, until the weekend, I just want to say Sergio was the BEST and I cannot thank him and you enough. It was incredible! Sergio went beyond his guide duties. The only issue is we are broke and my son, Hunter, wants a camera now:-)! Thanks to Sergio he wants to pick up photography! I will send photos this weekend after I download them.<br>
Thanks again! We loved Rhodes! (June 28th)<br>

Dear Nicholas<br>
Thank you for organising the most wonderful tour for my family.<br>
Our drivers Gianis and Stathis were excellent. Gianis was very fluent in English and his knowledge of the island meant that we found Rhodos to be our favourite Greek island. Stathis was always helpful and polite and he to was very good company. Cars were very comfortable and we would certainly recommend you to our friends.<br>
I wish you luck with the current austerity problems which you are suffering in Greece and hope it all works out well for you.<br>
Yours sincerely (June 21st)<br>

Dear Nicholas & Michael, Thank you.<br>
Our day in Rhodes with your brother Michael was a highlight of our 2 week vacation to Greece and Turkey. Michael did an outstanding job in all areas. He was very knowledgable and Larry particularly enjoyed talking to him, finding him very bright and articulate. I loved the way he spoke and made comparisons. It was a great day and thanks too for letting us find another couple to share the day with.<br>
Best wishes to you and your family,<br>

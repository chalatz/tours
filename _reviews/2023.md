Hi Nick, we really enjoyed the time today exploring Rhodes with your wonderful drivers. The sun even came out so we were able to enjoy the colors of the beautiful waters around Rhodes. We will always have happy memories and some great photos of our time in Rhodes. Thanks again

Nicholas, we had a great day! John T. was awesome and Rhodes is beautiful. I will write a review on TripAdvisor when we return home. **Colleen C (April 16th) Doylestown, Pennsylvania, US**

Nick, we absolutely loved our time with the driver (please wish him hello for us) and loved Rhodes.  Even our grand-daughter said she wanted to come back when the water was warm because the beaches were gorgeous!  I just left you a great review on Trip Advisor...Cheers. and hope to see you again sometime.  **Joni H. (April 5) the Colony, Texas, US**

Thank you very much Nicholas! My family had a very fun time with Manolis and Kostas! Kostas was great! He showed us Rhodes that makes us want to come back and visit for more than just a cruise stop! thank you so much for having a wonderful driver and Kostas to make our short visit very memorable!
Thank you again and will recommend your company to friends who will be visiting Rhodes!  **Lea N. and Family (Jan 30) New York, USA**

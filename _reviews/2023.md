Hi Nicholas, We enjoyed our time in Rhodes and our time touring with Manuel. Everything for our tour worked as described and made for a most pleasurable day exploring your island.  Thanks again for a great day! **Janice (March 22nd) Boston, Massachusetts, USA**

Nicholas, thank you! It was a lovely tour of Rhodes, which we all enjoyed!  Sergio was great. Wishing you the best with the new season. **Nancy and Dr John C. (March 11th) Hollywood, FL, USA**

Thank you very much Nicholas! My family had a very fun time with Manolis and Kostas! Kostas was great! He showed us Rhodes that makes us want to come back and visit for more than just a cruise stop! thank you so much for having a wonderful driver and Kostas to make our short visit very memorable!
Thank you again and will recommend your company to friends who will be visiting Rhodes!  **Lea N. and Family (Jan 30) New York, USA**

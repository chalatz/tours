Thank you, Nicholas.  We had such a great time in Rhodes.  Kostas was a great tour guide and my family had an amazing experience.  We did cut it a little short because my mother has limited mobility, so it didn't make much sense to make the walk down to the town in the last area.  I forgot the name.  But it did not take away from the beauty of the day.  I am a travel advisor and will definitely share your information with my other Travel Advisor friends.  Your communication is greatly appreciated and made me feel secure in knowing we would be well taken care of.  And to Manuel, the driver...we wish him good luck in his upcoming wedding.  Thank you again to you and your team for a wonderful excursion.  **Maile B. (July 12th ) Peoria, AZ, USA**

Dear Nicholas, Kostas and Christos, Thank you very much for organizing our tour. We all had a lovely time, Kostas was an excellent guide, very knowledgeable and able to adapt his style to suit any question or situation, he kept the children entertained throughout. They loved hearing the stories of the Greek gods. Christos was brilliant at navigating our way around all the twists and turns and looking after us all. Please pass on my sincere thanks to them both. **Kind regards Emma K. (7th July) Leinster, Irland **

Hi Nick.  We really enjoyed our excursion on Rhodes. Emmanual was very friendly and informative and allowed us plenty of time to see everything we wanted to see. Regards **Cheryl P. (1st July) Whangarei, New Zealand**

Thank you, Nicholas. Manuel was an excellent tour-driver.  His knowledge of Rhodes was impressive and enlightening. Although I had requested olive oil and wine tasting ahead of time by the end of our stop at Lindos we had decided we wanted to get back to the ship to do some last-minute shopping in Rhodes. The car that your company provided was very comfortable. Thank you again for an excellent day in Rhodes. **Maureen M. (June 23rd) Mission Viejo, CA, USA**

Nick, we’re home and trying to recover from an incredible vacation. Rhodes was our favorite port stop of all and likely related to our day with Andrew! He was so knowledgeable and personable. He customized the day and stops specially to our interests. We saw ceramics and olive oil. We enjoyed the day so much. Thank you. We would recommend this service to everyone! **Abbey D. & Family (June 16th) Tampa, US**

Nick, we absolutely loved our time with the driver (please wish him hello for us) and loved Rhodes.  Even our grand-daughter said she wanted to come back when the water was warm because the beaches were gorgeous!  I just left you a great review on Trip Advisor...Cheers. and hope to see you again sometime.  **Joni H. (April 5) the Colony, Texas, US**  

Hi Nicholas, We enjoyed our time in Rhodes and our time touring with Manuel. Everything for our tour worked as described and made for a most pleasurable day exploring your island.  Thanks again for a great day! **Janice (March 22nd) Boston, Massachusetts, USA**

Nicholas, thank you! It was a lovely tour of Rhodes, which we all enjoyed!  Sergio was great. Wishing you the best with the new season. **Nancy and Dr John C. (March 11th) Hollywood, FL, USA**

Thank you very much Nicholas! My family had a very fun time with Manolis and Kostas! Kostas was great! He showed us Rhodes that makes us want to come back and visit for more than just a cruise stop! thank you so much for having a wonderful driver and Kostas to make our short visit very memorable!
Thank you again and will recommend your company to friends who will be visiting Rhodes!  **Lea N. and Family (Jan 30) New York, USA**

Nicholas, thank you! It was a lovely tour of Rhodes, which we all enjoyed!  Sergio was great. Wishing you the best with the new season. Nancy and Dr John C. (March 11th) Hollywood, FL, USA 

Thank you very much Nicholas! My family had a very fun time with Manolis and Kostas! Kostas was great! He showed us Rhodes that makes us want to come back and visit for more than just a cruise stop! thank you so much for having a wonderful driver and Kostas to make our short visit very memorable!
Thank you again and will recommend your company to friends who will be visiting Rhodes!  **Lea N. and Family (Jan 30) New York, USA**

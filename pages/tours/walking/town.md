Your tour will start from your designated point at the cruise part (or from your hotel). You will be guided to the **Medieval City**, passing through the **St. Catherine Gate** to visit the most important monuments of **the Burgos (town).** (Stop Photos)

An interior wall running east-wide was used to divide the Medieval City into two unequal portions. The smaller, northerly portion was known as the **Collachium**. The much larger, southern quarter was known as **Burgo, Burgus, Burgum, and Hora (town).** The place was a melting pot that people from all walks of life called home, although the Greeks were in the majority.

Your friendly passionate tour guide will give provide you with a brief lesson in history and describe the alleyways of the medieval neighborhoods, its impressive buildings, and the different time periods that are a part of Rhodes. The medieval city was shaped by churches, mosques, and synagogues throughout the centuries. (Stop Photos)

Midway through the trip, you will get an optional short break for refreshments and coffee.

Your walking tour will now commence towards **Collachio**, also known as the smaller, northern portion of the medieval city. The Collachio surrounds the **Castello -- Grand Master Palace** -- which was inhabited by the Grand Masters and **the Administration of the Knights of St. John**. (Stop Visit Photos - *Walking Tour into the Grand Master Palace*)

Exploration of the **Collachio** will continue downhill towards the impressive **Street of the Knights** which connect the Grand Master Palace to **the New Hospital of the Knights**, which is now modern-day **Archeological Museum of Rhodes**. **Our Lady of the Castel** will also come into view, now known as the **Byzantine Museum**. (Stop Photos)

The tour ends at the **Marine Gate**. You can choose to be dropped back to your hotel, ship or stay in the Old Town for independent tourism. The Cruise Port is at a 10-minute walk from the Old Town.

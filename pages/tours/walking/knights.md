Your tour will commence from your selected point or cruise port. You will make your journey to the Medieval City to the **Marina Gate**. Our passionate experienced tour guides will provide you with a memorable detour of the unique medieval fortifications. Most defensive walls belonging to this era were constructed using a technique known as "rubble masonry," which is highly resistant to massive force. The external stone texture is smooth enough to prevent climbing. (Stop Photos)

Walking into the moat will reveal the cannon stone balls and bastions. Our tour guide will provide you with a brief overview of medieval military techniques, mentioning the important role the **Knights of St. John** played to extend fortifications of the castle during their time in Rhodes.

Some of the important medieval military techniques-sites include: **Naillac Tower**, **St Paul's Gate, the Moat and the Defence System, D'Amboise Gate and its Triple Defensive Belt** (Stop Photos)

You will make your way to the **Grand Master Palace**, which functioned as a palace, fortress, and headquarters for **the Knights Hospitallers**. (Stop Visit Photos - *Walking Tour into the Grand Master Palace*)

Next, you will walk down the hill towards the impressive **Street of the Knights**, linking the **Grand Master Palace** to the **New Hospital of the Knights**, which is now the **Archeological Museum of Rhodes**. **Our Lady of the Castle** (**Byzantine Museum**) will also come into view.

Reaching the **Marina Gate** will mark the end of the tour. You may choose to be dropped to your hotel or ship or stay near the Old Town for independent tourism. Please keep in mind that making it back to your ship is your own responsibility. The Cruise Port is situated at a 10-minute walk from the Old Town.

  items:
  - q: 'Q: Are there any entrance fees on this tour? '
    a: 'A: No entrance fees on this tour '
  - q: 'Q: Why does the tour start from the St John Gate (a.k.a. the Red Gate)? '
    a: 'A: We start from the St John Gate (and not from the Athanasius Gate where
      everybody else starts) because we want you to have a more intimate and detailed
      walking tour in the Medieval City.  We don’t follow the usual big group tour
      routes.  We don''t herd you in a big crowd.  We walk via little enticing / captivating
      alleys.  That way, you get more information, and experience, not just the tourist
      areas, but the real Medieval City.'
  - q: 'Q: Do other people join this walking tour?  Is it a semi-private tour?'
    a: 'A:  All of our tours are PRIVATE, just your party/group.  We don''t provide
      semi-private tours or share tours. '
  - q: 'Q: Can we cover all the sites as described above on our own pace? '
    a: 'A: Yes, of course.  The tour guide will concentrate just on you, and adjust
      the tour to your needs. Your professional tour guide will assist you as a friend
      and enhance / increase, your stay on the island. How is that possible?  By giving
      you information that you can use after the tour is finished, such as ”what to
      do and see” for the rest of your holidays. He can suggest additional places
      to visit, attractions and destinations on Rhodes that you may have never heard
      of, helping you to maximize your visit to Rhodes.'
  - q: 'Q: Why should I take a Private Walking Tour. What makes this Tour stand out?'
    a: "A: 100% Flexibility.  Ask your tour guide as many questions as you wish, stop
      for pictures wherever you want, you can even change parts of the program, for
      example if you don’t need a dinner you can have more time for shopping or you
      can have a drink at a place with music etc. You can also start the tour at your
      desired time (Later than 6:00 PM)\n\nCan you really do all these things with
      a big group tour?  We think our way is better.    \n"

You will be driven **from your hotel** to the Medieval City, where you will pass through the **St. John's Gate, also known as Red Gate**

Our knowledgeable passionate tour guides will give you lots of tidbits and information related to the **atmospheric alleys**, describing in detail the role played by the **Knights of Rhodes** in shaping the city's history and landmarks. (Stop Photos)

You will make your way past the impressive **Palace of the** **Grand Master** also known as **Kastello**, which was restored in 1930. Today, it is a museum that houses mosaics and architectural exhibits from around the island.(Stop Photos)

The walking tour will continue downhill towards the **Street of the Knights**. This is considered by many people to be the most interesting part of the Old City and its most important street. This street has been completely restored and its medieval heritage preserved, allowing you to take a peek back in time to observe how the warriors spent their time in either prayer or military practice.(Stop Photos)

This will provide you with a chance to **break free to shop around** or explore the Old Town on your own. You can shop for little souvenirs and traditional Greek goods to take back with you.

As the final part of your journey comes to an end, you will meet your tour guide at the designated meeting point and **dine at a local cuisine for dinner**.

Afterwards, you will head to the **New Town** to continue the walking guided tour to **Mandraki Old Port** and finish the tour off by going back to your hotel.

faq:
  items:
  - q: Can we stop from time to time to take photos?
    a: There will be plenty of time. The headsets you wear will make sure you hear
      the tour guide as long as you stay within 25-50 feet. This’ll give you the freedom
      to move around and enjoy the tour, instead of huddling together. The guide will
      make sure every guest can experience the tour without missing important landmarks.
  - q: We are two persons, but we need a driver and a licensed tour guide.  Is it
      compulsory a minimum number of passengers for this type of tours?
    a: No. The tour is private and sufficient even with one person. If you need to
      reduce the individual cost, we would suggest having more people in your party.
  - q: There are four more people would like to join the tour with us, can we add
      them to our group?
    a: Any last-minute additions to the number of passengers must be submitted at
      least 24 hours in advance so we can check for availability and update your reservation.
      In order to comply with Port Authority and Security, we provide the tour only
      for the number of passengers declared in the reservation.
  - q: What is the entrance fee for the Acropolis of Lindos?
    a: It’s 12 Euros per person for Adults, 6 Euros for seniors (with Id or Passport)
      and no charge for those under 18. The village of Lindos doesn’t have an entrance
      fee at all.
  - q: In case we decide to not climb to the Acropolis – is it possible to photograph
      it from the bottom? Is the climb difficult and are there handrails?
    a: The stairs are perfectly OK. The risers are 5-7 inches, and the treads measure
      up to 18-24 inches. These aren’t fitted with handrails on either side. You can
      photograph from the bottom, but you’ll get the good stuff on top.
  - q: Not all from our group maybe enthusiastic about the climb to the Acropolis
      of Lindos.
    a: That’s quite alright. Those that don’t want to climb can explore Lindos village
      instead. The two groups can meet at a prearranged location and time afterward.
  - q: How long will the stay be at Lindos? How long will the climb up and down the
      Acropolis take?
    a: The usual staying time at Lindos is 1.5 hours. However, it can vary depending
      on the travelers. (In case you need to spend more time in Lindos we need advance
      notice, on time of booking, as we must adjust the tour to your needs and wishes)
  - q: My Grand mother will be travelling with us. Since she won’t be able to make
      the climb, is there something for her to do while we climb the Acropolis?
    a: 'Yes, we can drive her to a café just outside the white village where she can
      enjoy a spectacular view of the village and the Acropolis of Lindos. You may
      also look at our <a href="./senior-citizens-tours-in-rhodes.htm">Seniors Tours
      in Rhodes</a> '
  - q: How long is the walk back to the ship from the gate near the Palace of Grand
      Master and the Archaeological Museum?
    a: It normally takes 10 minutes, but you can go at your own leisurely pace, enjoying
      the sights of the Old Town.
  - q: What are Rhodes’ famous delicacies and signature foods? Is there something
      we shouldn’t miss? What about a souvenir shop?
    a: The <a href="./food_greece_menus_meals_cuisine.htm">traditional food</a> and
      <a href="./rhodes_wine_tasting_tour.htm">wines</a> of Rhodes are delicious,
      the <a href="./handmade_pottery_greece.htm">ceramics</a> are to die for, and

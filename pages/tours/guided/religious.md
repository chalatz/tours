    **ANNUNCIATION OF THE VIRGIN MARY**

    The tour will begin with the church of the "Annunciation of the Virgin Mary" or "Evangelismos tis Theotokou". It's an Orthodox Church which is located very near the entrance of the old port Mandraki. Is a copy of the St. John's the Baptist catholic church in the Medieval City which was built by the Knights of St John Hospitallers. The Church is styled as a 3 aisled gothic basilica with a wooden roof. The roof contains a beautiful blend of Byzantine and Gothic elements. Due to the needs of the Orthodox denomination, the interior was adjusted in 1947 according to their requirements. The frescos were pained by the hagiographer extraordinaire, Photis Kontoglou (1952- 1962 A.D.) However, it still remains as it was on the outside.

    **OUR LADY OF FILERIMOS**

    As we move on from this breathtaking site, we venture out of Rhodes Town and come upon the West Coast. Here, the Church of "Our Lady of Filerimos" awaits us. It is situated atop the Filerimos hill - the Acropolis of Ancient Lalisos. In the days of early Christianity, this was the temple of Athena Polias. It was turned into a Christian three-aisled basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Since then, the Church has become well known for housing the **Virgin of Filerimos** (Our Lady of Filerimos), which is an icon for the Island. The "Lady of Filerimos" is kept in the monastery surrounded by cloisters and cells. The monastery was constructed in the 14th century under the rule of the Knights of St. John. Today the icon can be seen at the Blue Chapel of the National Museum of Montenegro, in Filerimos Monastery you can see a copy of it

    **THE WAY OF THE CROSS**

    If you cross the outside fence opposite the entrance, you will be treated to the sight of the beautiful "Way of the Cross". It's a paved corridor with engravings on one side. The entire pathway is perched on pedestals that represent the Passion of the Christ. When you come to the end, you are witness to an 18-meter tall Cross. There is even a staircase that leads to the top for a breathtaking 360-degree view of the west and east coast of the island.

    **ST FRANCIS OF ASSISI**

    As we return, we take the road of Monte Smith. The road meanders through the Ancient Acropolis of Rhodes Town. One the way you are treated to stunning views of the City and the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas. The first site we see as we arrive at the **Gate of St Athanasius** of the Medieval City, is the **Catholic Church of St. Francis of Assisi.** This is the official Latin Rite Parish church of Rhodes; it was completed in 1939. Larger than the Santa Maria, this Church eventually became the Parish church of the Franciscan Mission in Rhodes.

    The tour will take you through the Old Town to visit the Orthodox church of **Agios
    Fanourios** (St Fanourios). It is located at the namesake street in the Medieval
    Town of Rhodes. Built in the 13th century A.D, the interior adorned with beautiful
    frescos. During the Ottoman Occupation, it was officiated as a Mesgit (Small Mosque).
    Before the Ottoman Period, there is no known testimony for its name. The Italian
    Archaeological Service preserved its interior during the 1920s. Following WWII,
    it was taken over by the Greeks and then inaugurated and dedicated to Agios Fanourios
    in 1946.

    the ruins of the **Catholic church of Saint John's of the Knights Hospitallers**
    await. The Knights officially handed over rule to the Ottomans on December 27th
    1522 A.D. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent himself prayed at this church. It was
    later to become the most important Muslim place of worship, the "Great Mosque
    of Rhodes". The temple, like many others on the island was a three-aisled gothic
    basilica with a wooden roof. However, an unfortunate explosion occurred that destroyed
    it. The Metropolitan Church of "**Virgin Mary's Annunciation"** mimics the patterns
    of this temple.

    is another gothic basilica with three aisles; however, it also features two arcades
    created by four columns and pointed arches. Built in the 14th century, the Church
    also goes by the "**Church of the Virgin Mary of Mercy**". Partial restoration
    has occurred over the years and the area is open to the public. Even music events
    are held here at times.

- text: The final stop on our tour is the **Orthodox Church of St Panteleimonas.**
    Located on the Northeast end of Medieval Town, near Agia Ekaterini's Gate, it
    was constructed after the first Ottoman Siege on July 27th, 1480 AD. The day is
    commemorated with The Day of the Churches Celebration. There is no evidence of
    it being turned in to a Mosque during the Ottoman Period. According to Allert
    Gabriel, who visited Rhodes in 1923, it had become a residence for Jewish families.
    However, it became a customs office run by Italians at an unknown time. The British
    used it as a police station, and after the Second World War, it was used as a
    shelter for refugees. The Metropolitan Bishop of Rhodes, on one of his visits,
    realized the site was a temple. After considerable restoration work in collaboration
    with the Archaeological Service, the Church was consecrated on April 25th 1948
    A.D.

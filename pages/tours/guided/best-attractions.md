faq:
  items:
  - q: Does the tour give us time to stop and take photos as well as to truly appreciate
      the beauty of the island?
    a: Yes, there is plenty of time, and you will find that you can look around and
      take photos pretty comfortably. This is because as long as you remain within
      25-50 feet of the tour guide, you’ll be able to hear him through your special
      headsets. The tour guide also has enough experience to adjust the tour as you
      pass each landmark. So, you should be completely fine all the way.
  - q: We are two persons but would love to have a driver and a licensed tour guide.  Is
      it compulsory a minimum number of passengers?
    a: 'No. The tour is private and sufficient even with one person. '
  - q: I'd like to know how much this tour it cost per person
    a: All the tours are 100% private, not semi-private share-tours, or bus-tours,
      no strangers in the vehicle. The tour will be conducted <u>only for you</u>,
      obviously the price cannot be per person, but per group-service (even if you
      are one person).
  - q: There are four more people would like to join the tour with us, can we add
      them to our group?
    a: Any last-minute additions to the number of passengers must be submitted at
      least 24 hours in advance so we can check for availability and update your reservation.
      In order to comply with Port Authority and Security, we provide the tour only
      for the number of passengers declared in the reservation.
  - q: What is the cost to enter the Acropolis of Lindos?
    a: Adults must pay 20 Euros per person. The entrance is free for children under
      18 years of age. Lindos Village doesn’t have an entrance fee at all.
  - q: If some of us don’t want to climb the Acropolis, is it feasible to take photos
      from the bottom? For those of us that do, are there handrails?
    a: The stairs are mostly safe and secure. The risers are 5-7 inches, and the treads
      measure about 18-24 inches. These aren’t your typical stairs, and there aren’t
      any handrails to support you on either side. You can take pictures of the hillside
      if you decide not to go, but the truly great views are at the top.
  - q: Each of our 16 members may not be interested in climbing to the Acropolis.
      What are they to do?
    a: The members that want to climb can go with our tour guide, and the rest can
      explore Lindos village by themselves. The two groups can meet at a prearranged
      place and time.
  - q: How long is the stay in Lindos and how long will the climb to the Acropolis
      take?
    a: The tour stays there for approximately 90 minutes, but it can vary depending
      on the time guests take to enjoy Lindos. In case you need to spend more time
      in Lindos we need advance notice, on time of booking, as we must adjust the
      tour to your needs and wishes.  However you may also look at our tour <a href="./lindos-on-your-own.htm">Visit
      Lindos on your own pace</a> which give you 3:00 hours in Lindos
  - q: My 84 year old grandmother is along for the trip. Are there any options for
      her while my son climbs to the Acropolis of Lindos?
    a: 'There is a café just outside the village that offers an enchanting view of
      the white village and the Acropolis. We can drive her there for a drink and
      relaxation. You may also look at our <a href="./senior-citizens-tours-in-rhodes.htm">Seniors
      Tours in Rhodes</a> '
  - q: How near is the ship from the Palace of Grand Master and the Archaeological
      Museum?
    a: It’s ten minutes away, but you can take as long as you wish, enjoying the sights
      of the Old Town.
  - q: What are the scrumptious delicacies Rhodes is famous for? What shouldn’t we
      miss?
    a: The great <a href="./rhodes_wine_tasting_tour.htm">wines</a> and <a href="./food_greece_menus_meals_cuisine.htm">traditional
      food</a> at Rhodes is worth every cent. The famous <a href="./handmade_pottery_greece.htm">pottery,
      ceramics</a>, and the beautiful <span class="link_inline"><a href="beach_tour_of_rhodes.htm">Rhodes
      Beaches</a></span>
  - q: I have read some of the reviews, so I’m sure we’ll have fun.
    a: We certainly hope so!

**THE MEDIEVAL CITY**

Your tour will begin from Old Town, Medieval City, which is a **World Heritage Site** where you will pass through the **D'Amboise Gate**. (which is located on the highest point of the Medieval City, so you can walk downhill)  This begins your Guided Walking Tour with your tour guide. Here you can take pictures from outside of the most important monuments of the old town including: **The Grand Masters Palace**, **the Street of the Knights**, **the Ruins of Sent John Cathedral**, **the Archeological Museum**, **the Byzantine Museum.**   Your walking tour end at the **Marine Gate** where you will find your Vehicle / Driver waiting for you to start the next phase of your tour.

**THE NEW TOWN**

You will be driven to the New Town where you will be able to catch a glimpse of the **Mandraki Old Harbor**. According to tradition, **the Colossus of Rhodes**, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, was built here. <u>Guided Tour</u> (Stop Visit Photos).   Near the harbor is the **Church of the Annunciation**, which is home to famous wall artwork by the likes of Fotis Kontoglou and other artists. The place has since been transformed into the town's Cathedral.  Then past the rest of the imposing buildings, where the **Venetian, Gothic and Oriental elements** blend and the north point of the island where the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea meet.

**MONTE SMITH**

Your trip will continue upwards to Monte Smith - **the Acropolis of Rhodes City** -- for a panoramic drive for picturesque views of the town. The temple of Apollo is situated towards your left and the beautiful Aegean Sea with its vibrant blue water is towards the right. (Stop Photos).

**THE JOURNEY TO LINDOS**

The journey to Lindos takes you through a **50-km or 32-mile** drive along the east coast of the island, where you'll catch glimpses of beautiful villages, the blue turquoise sea, and a landscape filled with orange and olive trees.

**RHODIAN TRADITIONAL ART**

Your tour guide will make a brief stop at a local pottery workshop. Here you'll see how the potter works at his wheel to make **the famous rhodian potteries**. You can also learn the mystery of the Pythagorean cup. <u>Guided Tour</u> (Stop Visit Photos).

**PANORAMIC VIEW OF LINDOS**

The east coast also provides impressive views of **the Acropolis of Lindos** along with glimpses of the **white village** in a strikingly beautiful bay below. (Stop Photos).

**ST PAUL'S BAY**

Your next visit is to St. Paul's Bay, towards the south of Lindos, where according to local tradition, **apostle Paul** used to preach Christianity to the Rhodians. The famous cave, where the film **"The Guns of Navarone"** was made, also comes into view. <u>Guided Tour</u>  (Stop Photos)

**LINDOS VILLAGE AND ACROPOLIS**

At this point, you have two options:

**Option 1:** Embark on a guided walking tour through Lindos Village, navigating narrow cobblestone pathways and ascending the steps to the Acropolis. At the summit, you'll be rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views and a glimpse into the remnants of ancient civilizations. (Stop for visits and photos.)

**Option 2:** Skip the 292-step climb and enjoy a more relaxed experience. Your guide will take you to scenic vantage points where you can admire the Acropolis from a distance and capture stunning photos, avoiding both the crowds and the heat, especially during peak season.

**COASTAL ROAD OF FALIRAKI AND KALLITHEA**

The return journey will take you to the sandy beaches of **Faliraki** through the coastal road and the **Kallithea Sea**.

**BACK TO THE STARTING POINT**

Towards the end of your journey to Rhodes Town, you can choose to go back to your hotel, to your ship, or near the Old Town's city gates to visit the area on your own. The ship is docked just a quarter of a mile away but returning back on foot is your own responsibility.

The tour will begin from your selected drop off point, and you'll be driven to the east coast in a Mercedes-Benz Sedan Car. The first place on your tour will be the Seven Springs, a valley filled with springs and pine trees. It's an oasis in the summer for inhabitants and tourists alike.

**EMBONA VILLAGE - WINE TASTE - LOCAL PRODUCTS**

We continue our journey southwest to the charming village of Embona, nestled in the heart of Rhodes. **The scenic drive offers breathtaking views**, winding through lush forests, dramatic cliffsides, and sprawling grape vineyards Embona is renowned as the island's largest grape producer and home to some of the finest wines in Rhodes. You'll visit a local winery to enjoy a delightful wine tasting experience, sampling the three famous Rhodian wine varieties: the crisp **White Wine,** the rich **Red Wine**, and the luscious **Sweet White**.   Beyond its exceptional wines, Embona is also celebrated for its **high-quality honey, olives, olive oil, aromatic herbs, and Souma**, a traditional Rhodian aperitif similar to ouzo. Here, you'll find an array of authentic, homemade local products that make perfect gifts for friends and family, offering them a true taste of Greece with items that travel well without refrigeration

**CASTLE OF KRITINIA**

The medieval castle of Kritinia is next on our list. Built in the sixteenth century by the Knights of St. John Hospitallers, it is located outside the village of Kritinia. It overlooks the bay atop a pine dotted hill and presents a panoramic view of the islands of **Chalki, Alimia, Makri, Strongyle, Tragoussa and Symi**. (Stop Visit Photos)

**LUNCH BREAK AT A SEASIDE RESTAURANT**

After this you can take a break and indulge in some snacks or some lunch (at your own expense). You can try one of the seaside restaurants that serves seafood, Greek cuisine and homemade wines by the shore.

**BACK TO THE STARTING POINT**

The tour proceeds back through the west coast overlooking the Aegean Sea (scenic) and transports you to the hotel, the ship, or near the city gates of Old Town. If you choose to be dropped off at the latter, you will have to make your own way back to the ship which is docked a quarter of a mile away.

faq:
  items:
  - q: How long are the stops to take pictures? Will we have time to really look around?
    a: As you can expect, some spots are more time-consuming than others. With this
      in mind, there is no set time for each highlight. You will have plenty of time
      to look around and take photos of the landmarks and we watch how the tour progresses
      at each landmark and adjust the tour accordingly.
  - q: Can we drive any closer to the Acropolis of Lindos? My mother will not be able
      to do extend walking.
    a: No cars can drive up. To reach the Acropolis of Lindos you will be required to climb 292 steps. Still worth it!!
  - q: How much is the entrance fee in the Acropolis of Lindos?
    a: Entrance fee is 20 Euros per person in the Acropolis. Children under 18 years old free.
  - q: Can you tell us, if we decide to not climb the Acropolis - can we take pictures
      of it from the bottom? Are there handrails or would it be a difficult climb?
    a: For the most part the stairs really are ok. The risers are maybe 5-7 inches
      and the treads about 18-24 inches. Not really normal stairs. No handrail on
      either side. Yes, you can take pictures from below (of a hillside.) The good
      ones are at the top.
  - q: We actually have a group of 12 people, but all might not be interested in this
      itinerary.
    a: You can have 3 cars which means maximum of flexibility. You can visit Lindos as a group of 12 people, and then you can split to the different itineraries of your choices. Or if you are in a minibus we can customize the tour for you.
  - q: Some of the group want to climb to the Acropolis above Lindos while others
      want to just explore Lindos village.
    a: No problem. We will meet all of you later at the main square of Lindos.
  - q: "How long will we stay in Lindos village? How long will the couples climbing
      and looking at the Acropolis take?"
    a: Usually we spend one hour in Lindos, but it depends on you for how long you
      need to visit Lindos. To climb up it takes 10 - 15 min, to take a look 30min.
      However you may look at our tour <a href="./lindos-on-your-own.htm">Visit Lindos
      on your own pace</a> which can give you 3:00 hours in Lindos
  - q: I will be travelling with an elderly grandmother. She is 84-year-old. If my
      mother decides not to go up, is there anything for a lady in her age to do while
      my son and I go up?
    a: 'Yes, we can drive her at a vantage point, have a drink and a nice discuss with the driver and enjoy the panoramic view of the white village and the Acropolis of Lindos while she is waiting for you. You may also look at our <a href="./senior-citizens-tours-in-rhodes.htm">Seniors Tours in Rhodes</a> '
  - q: We are a family of 4 people, 2 adults and 2 children ages 6 and 9 years. Challenge
      is to see highlights AND keep kids entertained...
    a: The "Best of Rhodes" Half Day tour it is also an Educational and Entertainment tour. The kids love Knights Stories, castles and old midlevel cities, also Greek mythology and ancient wonders like the world famous Colossus of Rhodes. 
  - q: How long does it take a walk back to our ship from the gate near the Palace
      of Grand Master and the Archaeological Museum?
    a: Usually it takes less than 10 min, however, you can do it as long as you wish,
      enjoying a nice walk through the Old Town.
  - q: What is Rhodes known for, in terms of food / beverage and souvenirs? What's
      the one thing we shouldn't miss?
    a: <span class="link_inline"><a href="food_greece_menus_meals_cuisine.htm">Traditional
      Food of Rhodes</a></span>, <span class="link_inline"><a href="rhodes_wine_tasting_tour.htm">Wines</a></span>,

Our tour will conclude at one of the Old Town gates, allowing you to explore independently. Enjoy your leisurely stroll back to the ship; it's just a quick 10-minute walk from the Medieval City to the Cruise Port. This way, you save both time and money, avoiding any waiting-time charges for the driver.

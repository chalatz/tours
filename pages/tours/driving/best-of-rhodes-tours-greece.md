faq:
  items:
  - q: How long are the stops to take pictures? Will we have time to really look around?
    a: As you can expect, some spots are more time-consuming than others. With this
      in mind, there is no set time for each highlight. You will have plenty of time
      to look around and take photos of the landmarks and we watch how the tour progresses
      at each landmark and adjust the tour accordingly.
  - q: Can we have conversations with the driver, can we ask him questions?
    a: 'The Drivers can give running commentaries of what you are seeing, lots of
      facts on every place you visit and of course enough time to visit each landmark,
      they also come with you to get your photos when it is allowed. They can also
      provide advice or adjust the tour to your needs in case you wish to extend it   '
  - q: Can we drive any closer to the Acropolis of Lindos? My mother will not be able
      to do extend walking.
    a: No cars can drive up. To reach the Acropolis of Lindos you will be required
      to climb 292 steps, or ride on a donkey. By the way, the donkey does not eliminate
      all the steps - there are over 80 to go when you get off the donkey. Still worth
      it!!
  - q: How much is the entrance fee in the Acropolis of Lindos?
    a: Entrance fee is 12 Euros per person in the Acropolis. Seniors (with Id or Passport)
      6 Euros per person. Children under 18 years old free. No charge to enter Lindos
      village.
  - q: Can you tell us, if we decide to not climb the Acropolis - can we take pictures
      of it from the bottom? Are there handrails or would it be a difficult climb?
    a: For the most part the stairs really are ok. The risers are maybe 5-7 inches
      and the treads about 18-24 inches. Not really normal stairs. No handrail on
      either side. Yes, you can take pictures from below (of a hillside.) The good
      ones are at the top.
  - q: Can you tell me about the "donkey ride" in Lindos? Is it fun or recommended?
      Does it take a lot of time?
    a: The "Lindos Taxi" as they call the donkeys in Lindos is fun, and if you have
      children with you, it is recommended! The children will love it. 10 euros for
      a donkey one-way up. It takes 10min to go up.
  - q: Do the donkeys use the same path and/or set of stairs that we would use to
      climb up?
    a: No, at Lindos the donkeys go by a slightly different path. So the stairs, and
      the soles of your shoes, will be quite clean!
  - q: We actually have a group of 12 people, but all might not be interested in this
      itinerary.
    a: You already have 3 cars which means maximum of flexibility. You can visit Lindos
      as a group of 12 people, and then you can split to the different itineraries
      of your choices. Or if you are in a minibus we can customize the tour for you.
  - q: Some of the group want to climb to the Acropolis above Lindos while others
      want to just explore Lindos village.
    a: No problem. We will meet all of you later at the main square of Lindos.
  - q: " How long will we stay in Lindos village? How long will the couples climbing
      and looking at the Acropolis take?"
    a: Usually we spend one hour in Lindos, but it depends on you for how long you
      need to visit Lindos. To climb up it takes 10 - 15 min, to take a look 30min.
  - q: I will be travelling with an elderly grandmother. She is 84-year-old. If my
      mother decides not to go up, is there anything for a lady in her age to do while
      my son and I go up?
    a: Yes, we can drive her down on the marvellous beach of Lindos have a drink and
      a nice discuss with the driver and enjoy the panoramic view of the white village
      and the Acropolis of Lindos while she is waiting for you. You may also look
      at our Tours for <a href="./Seniors-tours-in-rhodes.htm">Seniors</a> in Rhodes
  - q: We are a family of 4 people, 2 adults and 2 children ages 6 and 9 years. Challenge
      is to see highlights AND keep kids entertained...
    a: The "Best of Rhodes" Half Day tour it is also an Educational and Entertainment
      tour. The kids love Knights Stories, castles and old midlevel citys, also Greek
      mythology and ancient wonders like the world famous Colossus of Rhodes. They
      can run into the Old Stadium and feel the Old athletic spirit. Incredible views
      on the way for kids’ pictures, and of course they will love the donkey ride
      up to the Acropolis of Lindos!!
  - q: How long does it take a walk back to our ship from the gate near the Palace
      of Grand Master and the Archaeological Museum?
    a: Usually it takes less than 10 min, however, you can do it as long as you wish,
      enjoying a nice walk through the Old Town.
  - q: What is Rhodes known for, in terms of food / beverage and souvenirs? What's
      the one thing we shouldn't miss?
    a: <span class="link_inline"><a href="food_greece_menus_meals_cuisine.htm">Traditional
      Food of Rhodes</a></span>, <span class="link_inline"><a href="rhodes_wine_tours_wineries_greece.htm">Wines</a></span>,

From your selected point, you'll be driven to the **Old town -- Medieval City** (World Heritage Site), you'll pass through one of the gateways and by the Agora and the Collachium, where the **Knights of St. John of Jerusalem** lived and worked, building a stronghold of Christendom in the Eastern Mediterranean. Remaining remarkably intact, the Old Town is home to the churches, marble coats of arms of the Knights, cannon balls, the inns of the Knights, and most impressive the restored **Palace of the Grand Masters** (Stop Photos).

Then past the imposing buildings of the New town, in neo-colonial and Italianate style, which lend grandeur to this part of the present-day town. You continue to the entrance of the old harbor, atop tall columns, stand the two bronze deer - characteristic landmarks of the island. Here, according to tradition, was the place where the famous **Colossus of Rhodes**, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, once stood (Stop Visit Photos).

Near to the harbour is the **Church of the Annunciation** that houses amazing gothic wall paintings by Fotis Kontoglou and impressive chandeliers. Today it is the town's cathedral (Stop Visit Photos)

Then past the rest of the imposing buildings, where the Venetian, Gothic and Oriental elements blend. The **City Hall** located at the centre of Rhodes town at the historical location of the port. The impressive **Administration building** or **Governor's Palace** which houses the Prefecture of the Dodecanese. (Venetian Palace style design, with details of the Doge's Palace in Venice). The **National Theatre of Rhodes** is an impressive building ideally located in the Town Hall Square. It is one of the finest specimens of the International and the Italian style of architecture **"Teatro Puccini"**. The imposing **"Hotel of the Roses"** was built by the Italians, in 1932. Today it house's the **"Casino of Rhodes"**.

Then your journey to **Lindos** will take you along a beautiful, 50 km / 32 miles drive of the east coast of the island, past picturesque little villages, with many glimpses of the sea and a splendid landscape of orange and gnarled olive trees.

On the way you visit the **Anthony Quinn Bay**> - Takes its name from the famous Hollywood actor, who owns a large property in this area. Since filming the Guns of Navarone in Rhodes Island - scenic (Stop Visit Photos)

A short stop for the panoramic view of the **Tsambica beach** - scenic (Stop Photos)

On the way to Lindos, you can choose an optional short stop at a pottery workshop where the traditional pottery of Rhodes is made. You can see the wonderful pieces of art, and watch the potter working at his wheel. You can even learn the mystery of the Pythagorean cup. Just let your tour/driver know that you wish to make this short stop.

From a vantage point along the coast, the impressive Acropolis of Lindos will come into view with the white village situated in a picturesque bay below (Stop Photos)

You continue to the south of Lindos, to **St. Paul 's Bay**, where the apostle is said to have landed in the year 51 AD to preach Christianity to the Rhodians. From this point you can also view the cave where the film **"The Guns of Navarone"** was filmed. (Stop Visit Photos)

Marvel at the 4th century B.C. **Doric Temple of Athena Lindia**, a **double winged portico**, a **Byzantine church** and the **fortifications of the Knights**, including the remains of the Governor's quarters. This view is truly panoramic (Stop Visit Photos)

Upon returning to Rhodes Town, you may choose to be dropped back to your hotel or back to your ship, or near the city gates of the Old Town for independent browsing. You would then be responsible for your own return to the ship on foot, which will be docked approximately a quarter mile away.

summary:
  paragraphs:
  - This tour is for people who know how to appreciate "the drink of the Gods". Why
    not taste the island's local produce in wine, which holds a long - standing tradition?  A
    tour to Rhodes Wineries is addressed mostly to the selective wine tasters, but
    not exclusively.
  - "There are three well-known labels on Rhodes:\n    <ol class=\"tour__summary tour__summary--list\">\n
    \     <li><strong>White wine</strong> from the white grape variety <strong>Athiri
    (VDQS)</strong>, a classic Aegean variety cultivated in the wider area since antiquity.</li>\n
    \     <li><strong>Red wine (VDQS)</strong> from a red grape variety which has
    come to dominate almost all islands of the Aegean. <strong>Mandilaria (often also
    called Amorgiano)</strong> has found the most suitable environment for its requirements
    on Rhodes . Enjoy this dark wine with its delicate aroma of red fruit.</li>\n
    \     <li class=\"pb-0\"><strong>Sweet white wine (VDQS)</strong> produced by
    blending two varieties of Muscat grapes. <strong>Classic white Muscat (from Samos)</strong>
    and the <strong>Italian imported Trani Muscat</strong> blend harmoniously producing
    aromas of dried apricot, caramel and nuts and creating a pleasant taste that enchants
    the senses. Local wineries specialize in producing sparkling wines even using
    the champagne method of second fermentation in the bottle.</li>\n    </ol>      \n"

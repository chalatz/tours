faq:
  items:
  - q: How long are the stops to take pictures? Will we have time to really look around?
    a: As you can expect, some spots are more time-consuming than others. With this
      in mind, there is no set time for each highlight. You will have plenty of time
      to look around and take photos of the landmarks and we watch how the tour progresses
      at each landmark and adjust the tour accordingly.
  - q: Are there Butterflies all the time? - And are there opening times there too
      that we might have to take into consideration?
    a: There are Butterflies only during their season, from mid-June to mid-September.
      The Valley is open from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm.
  - q: How long time we need to pass through the "Valley of the Butterflies"? How
      much is the entrance fee?
    a: 'Actually it’s a hillside not a valley, with two gates, the Main Gate (lower
      gate) and the Secondary Gate (upper gate). You can have a quick look using the
      main gate (lower gate) for around 10 min, but if you want to climb up there
      is approximately 60 min of walking time (up and down). We drive our clients
      to the Secondary Gate (upper gate) so they can walk down easier (one way 30
      - 40 min).<br>Entrance fee: Low season 3 Euros per person / High season 5 Euro
      per person / kids under 12 years old free'
  - q: This is a full day tour, what if suddenly we need to use a W.C on the way?
    a: All the sights have W.C. facilities as well as the restaurants and the hotels.
  - q: How much are the entrance fees to Acropolis and the monastery of Ialyssos?
    a: No entrance fee for the Acropolis, for the monastery is 6 euro per person.
      <a href="./Seniors-tours-in-rhodes.htm">Seniors</a> (with Id or Passport) 3
      Euros / person
  - q: How long does it take a walk back to our ship from the gate near the Palace
      of Grand Master and the Archaeological Museum?
    a: Usually it takes less than 10 min, however, you can do it as long as you wish,
      enjoying a nice walk through the Old Town.
  - q: What is Rhodes known for, in terms of food / beverage and souvenirs? What's
      the one thing we shouldn't miss?
    a: '<a href="./food_greece_menus_meals_cuisine.htm">Traditional Food of Rhodes</a>,
      <a href="./rhodes_wine_tours_wineries_greece.htm">Wines</a>, the famous handmade

**BREAK FOR LUNCH**

This is a longer program includes the **"Best of Rhodes"** half day tour, and more time on the East Coast for break for delicious lunch experiences at a seaside village at the Mediterranean Sea right on the water’s edge (scenic) with fresh seafood, Rhodian cuisine and excellent local wines. (Stop Visit Taste Photos)

**VALLEY OF THE BUTTERFLIES**

On the way back you drive through the island, from the **East to the West Coast**, the road passes through villages and densely wooded areas, we come to the Valley of the Butterflies. This site is beautifully arranged with wooden bridges, from mid-June to mid-September thousands of butterflies appear. (Stop Visit Photos).

**THE TRADITIONAL WINERY**

After few miles we stop at a small Traditional Winery. Here you have the opportunity to free taste a selection of locally produced wines. As well as you get your pictures of the aging facilities. (Stop Visit Taste Photos)

**FILERIMOS MOUNTAIN**

We continue on the west coast, and after winding upwards for 3 miles on the Filerimos Mountain, we come to the ruins of the **Acropolis of the Ancient Ialyssos**. The plateau of Filerimos rises nearly 267 meter / 876 feet above sea level. Here you'll visit the Church of **Our Lady of Filerimos**, built upon the foundations of the ancient temple of Athena. You'll also see the exterior of the monastery and courtyard, as well as the barrel-vaulted Chapel of St. George.

**FILERIMOS - THE WAY OF THE CROSS**

On the right hand side there is a beautiful tree sheltered pathway the "Way of the Cross" This is a series of shrines with relief scenes of the Passion, which leads from the main square to the west edge of the plateau to the 16 meter / 48 feet cross, from which you can enjoy a stunning view. (Stop Visit Photos).  And through **Ixia**, one of the largest tourist settlements, back to Rhodes town.

**BACK TO THE STARTING POINT**

Upon returning to Rhodes Town, you may choose to be dropped back to your hotel or back to your ship, or near the city gates of the Old Town for independent browsing. You would then be responsible for your own return to the ship on foot, which will be docked approximately a quarter mile away.

faq:
  items:
  - q: Can we drive any closer to the Acropolis of Lindos? My mother will not be able
      to do extend walking.
    a: No cars can drive up. To reach the Acropolis of Lindos you will be required
      to climb 292 steps, or ride on a donkey. By the way, the donkey does not eliminate
      all the steps - there are over 80 to go when you get off the donkey. Still worth
      it!!
  - q: How much is the entrance fee in the Acropolis of Lindos?
    a: Entrance fee is 12 Euros per person in the Acropolis. Seniors (with Id or Passport)
      6 Euros per person. Children under 18 years old free. No charge to enter Lindos
      village.
  - q: Can you tell me about the "donkey ride" in Lindos? Is it fun or recommended?
      Does it take a lot of time?
    a: The "Lindos Taxi" as they call the donkeys in Lindos is fun, and if you have
      children with you, it is recommended! The children will love it. 10 euros for
      a donkey one-way up. It takes 10min to go up.
  - q: We actually have a group of 12 people, but all might not be interested in this
      itinerary.
    a: You already have 3 cars which means maximum of flexibility. You can visit Lindos
      as a group of 12 people, and then you can split to the different itineraries
      of your choices. Or if you are in a minibus we can customize the tour for you.
  - q: I will be travelling with an elderly grandmother. She is 84-year-old. If my
      mother decides not to go up, is there anything for a lady in her age to do while
      my son and I go up?
    a: 'Yes, we can drive her down on the marvellous beach of Lindos have a drink
      and a nice discuss with the driver and enjoy the panoramic view of the white
      village and the Acropolis of Lindos while she is waiting for you. You may also
      look at our <a href="./Seniors-tours-in-rhodes.htm">Tours for Seniors in Rhodes</a> '
  - q: What is Rhodes known for, in terms of food / beverage and souvenirs? What's
      the one thing we shouldn't miss?
    a: <span class="link_inline"><a href="food_greece_menus_meals_cuisine.htm">Traditional
      Food of Rhodes</a></span>, <span class="link_inline"><a href="rhodes_wine_tours_wineries_greece.htm">Wines</a></span>,

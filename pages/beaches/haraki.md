Haraki is a small beautiful fishing village. The beach is mixed, on the right hand side has large pebbles, to the left there is sand. Beds and umbrellas are available; also there is a changing area and showers. From the beach you'll have a view of the Feraklos castle (located on the place once stood an ancient Acropolis. The castle was used by pirates before the Knights of St. John ousted them, reinforced the castle than used it as a prison). Few small fishing boats set out daily to catch fish for the local restaurant which is very popular with the local Greeks, and chosen by numerous celebrities in the past.

The water is shallow for a long way out, making this a perfect spot to bring the kids for a swim.

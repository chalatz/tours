The main Kalithea spa beach is a favorite target of day trip boats from Rhodes Town , so it soon fills up with trippers, especially in the high season. There are umbrellas and sun beds in each of the Kalithea coves and the main beach also has its own "cafe" that opens in high season, a fine place to have a coffee or a drink in a fantastic environment.

A small sandy beach, with shallow sea water, and an attractive landscape.

Here is where the apostle is said to have landed in the year 51 AD to preach Christianity to the Rhodians. From this point you can also view the cave where the film "The Guns of Navarone" was filmed. Beds and umbrellas are available, also there is a changing area and showers. No water sports.

Described by Lawrence Durell, "Reflections on a Marine Venus" the beach of Rhodes city, as the finest beach in the whole Mediterranean . Elli lies between the Mandraki harbor, and the Aquarium, in the northern end of the town. 

Despite its length and width, Elli beach is packed tightly with umbrellas and can feel very crowded in the high season, but the sea is very cool and clear. Elli Beach features lots of sun loungers, nearby restaurants, a choice of water sports and even a volleyball count on the beachfront itself, one of the most cosmopolitan beaches.

Open only during the summer season, its only purpose is to provide its visitors a vacation that they will not forget. The beaches are primarily sand and the waters are crystal clear, smooth as glass. There is an abundant amount of sun beds to lay back on and work on your tan. For the more active, there are also many water sports to choose from including Bungee Jumps. Faliraki's beaches are only out done by its night life. Faliraki bursts with bars, clubs, dance halls, and some of the best restaurants found anywhere.

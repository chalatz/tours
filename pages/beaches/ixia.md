If you are looking for waves and strong winds this is a beach for you. Ixia is mostly a series of nearby beaches rather than one single beach. It is a favorite spot for windsurfers, and kite surfers. You will also find a number of windsurfing centers offering equipment and training so you can improve your technique on both windsurfing and kite surfing.

Ixia offers in the evening's very romantic sunsets.

    Just a quick message to say a big thank you to Michael for an excellent tour to Rhodes Town and Lindos. We really enjoyed it and my husband loved chatting to Michael about the history of Greece and other matters!!!! We will certainly put an excellent review on trip advisor! <br> Best regards  **Tracey and Family. (30th Oct) U.K.**

    Hello! Nicholas, It was a wonderful experience and I shall be writing a fabulous TripAdvisor. So thank you so much, I hope it will help to make your next season even better! <br> **Nicole and Spencer D. (15th Oct) U.K.**

    We contacted Nicholas, and were delighted to find that he was happy to arrange some bespoke tours. Our driver, Michael, was very friendly, helpful and flexible and more than happy to modify our itineraries on the day. The car was clean inside and out and Michael proved to be a very able driver with whom we felt very comfortable throughout. We would thoroughly recommend Rhodes Private Tours. <br>**Gerald, S & R (12th Oct) London U.K.**

    Hi Nicholas, You and Michael are the best. Rhodes/Rodos was a complete surprise with its beauty and history. We hope one day to return and spend more time. I wish you and Michael continued success with your tour company. It has to be the best in Rhodes.<br>**Lucinda W. (Oct 4th) Statesville**

    Michael was a fountain of information, sensitive to our needs and had a nice sense of humor. We saw gorgeous views of Rhodes. We stopped at a traditional restaurant popular with locals for a delicious lunch of Greek salad and other Greek starter specialties. Very pleased with the tour.<br>

    WA USA**\n\nVoy a expresarme de forma personal, pero hablo también de parte de
    todos los del grupo.\nLa visita el día de hoy a Rhodas ha sido una de las visitas
    más memorables de este viaje.\nRhodas, por sí misma, tiene un encanto particular.
    \ Alex hizo que ese encanto a demás de particular fuera dinámico, entrañable,
    exclusivo y sobretodo sensible.  Su conocimiento, pasión por su tierra y sus orígenes
    son impresionantes. Manolis, encantador, su habilidad en el volante hizo que tuviéramos
    un paseo sin sobresaltos.  Les decimos a los dos: MUCHAS GRACIAS!!!  \nCuenta
    con mis sinceras recomendaciones para quien sepa venga a Rhodas.\nTambién pondré
    mi comentario en Trip Advisor.<br>\nHa sido un placer haberte conocido.\n**Mónica
    (18 de noviembre)  Mexico City, Mexico**\n\nNicholas, we had a wonderful tour
    with Andrew who was exceptional! Thank you for the quality service.<br> **Donald
    (Nov 13) New York, US**\n\nNicholas, It was an outstanding day with a fabulous
    tour-driver!  He was very informative, considerate, professional and made our
    day very enjoyable. Your island is lovely!  I would highly recommend your company.

    Thank you for being part of our trip to Rhodes. **Bev (Nov 1st)  Winnipeg, Manitoba,
    Canada**\n\nNicholas, Can not thank Kostas enough, a real Rhodes scholar. He is
    a charming, engaging, and entertaining tour guide. A special thanks to the driver
    Jacob for those special photo ops and taking us around the island in comfortable
    relaxed way.  I would definitely recommend your team as a best  way to experience
    Rhodes. <br> **Ken  (Nov 1st) Ontario, Canada**\n\nHi Nicholas, I agree with Ken’s
    comments.  It was an informative and fun way to enjoy your beautiful island!!
    \ <br> **Linda and John (Nov 1st) USA**\n\nNicholas, we enjoyed the tour immensely!
    \ What a beautiful island with so much history.  Emmanuel did a fantastic job
    of showing us the highlights we wanted to see in the time available.  He was very
    personable and knowledgeable and spoke excellent English.  He is the consummate
    professional tour driver. Thanks for your excellent service.  **Wayne (Oct 22nd)
    Ramona, CA**\n\nHi Nicholas The tour was great. Michael did a great job with the
    tour, while giving us some of our own time to explore. Your island was a great
    surprise to us because we underestimated the beauty and its sights. I see why
    your tours get great reviews. <br>\nRegards **Jeffrey  (Oct 20th) Oceanside CA,
    USA**\n\nHello Nicholas and Michael, I just submitted a review of 5 stars for
    you.  It was such a nice experience to see Rhodes as a local with Michael. We
    all agreed Rhodes was the favorite island we visited. In fact one lady who was
    traveling with me decided she wants to come back and stay a few months maybe next
    year. So you may see some of us again!  Thanks so much for a lovely visit to your
    island home. <br>\n**Joyce, Phillip, Sabrina, Adrienne.  (Oct 19th) USA**\n\nThank
    you for the business you provide and Dominic did a wonderful job. As I told him,
    he is perfect for that position. He had my dad laughing like I have not seen in
    a while.  We were very pleased and when I have a good internet connection, I will
    definitely write a review on trip advisor and your site. <br>\nBlessings to you
    and your great crew, **Jenny (Oct 19th) USA**\n\nHi Nicholas, Thank you for arranging
    a wonderful day, Roberto and I really enjoyed our day in Rhodes very much and
    loved each and every stop!  Our experience was thanks to Mike as well, he was
    extremely kind, knowledgeable and took his time to explain the sights and give
    us great suggestions.  He was also a really good driver and made the trip very
    comfortable. If I have the opportunity to visit Rhodes again, I would absolutely
    go on this trip again and request Mike as the driver. :)  I would also definitely
    recommend your services without a doubt to other people.<br>\nKeep up the great
    work!  Kind regards, **Janet (Oct 18th)  MA USA**\n\nNicholas Thank you very much!!!
    \ Everything was perfect and we enjoyed the whole day. Michael is great and we
    had so much fun with him.  I'm adding a screen shot of the review I published
    in TripAdvisor. <br>\nThank's again for everything. I'm sure we'll meet again.
    \ Keren (Oct 17th)  **Tel Aviv, Israel**\n\nNicholas: Thank you for the tour.
    Rhodes was the highlight of our trip, and the tour with you was a large part of
    that.<br>\n**Bill (Oct 15th) USA**\n\nThank you very much for two wonderful tours.
    \ We really enjoyed both guides and learned so much.  The service, knowledge and
    professionalism was amazing. We are so glad that we used your services<br>\n**Best
    Linda (Oct 13th) USA**\n\nGood Day, We really enjoyed the tour - the driver Michael
    was exceptional in his knowledge and overall delivery. All was perfect!<br> ​
    **Helene & Romeo (Oct 12th) Quebec, Canada**\n\nHi Nicholas, Thanks for the great
    service! Mike is awesome! We will definitely engage your service for more tours
    the next time we are back!<br> Cheers, **Brenda (Oct 10th) NY, USA**\n\nHi Nicholas
    we had an amazing day and Kostas was the best guide we've had on this trip. We
    feel very lucky to have him as our guide. This was our first time to Greece and
    Rhodes was our favourite of the 4 islands we visited. It was a truly memorable
    day. Your teams attention to detail is superb. I plan to write a review on trip
    advisor when we get home. I hope to return to Rhodes again and will definitely
    contact you if we are lucky enough to get that opportunity.<br> All the best,
    **Lynda (Oct 9th) Canada**\n\nNicholas, We had a wonderful tour with Yannis and
    Mike and I have given you a very positive review on TripAdvisor. I was in the
    car with Yannis and found him very interesting on all sites of subjects. You certainly
    gave us a great driver who I would ask for again should I visit Rhodes again.
    As a group we live interesting people.<br> Thanks again! **Tom A. (Oct 8th) Southampton
    UK**\n\nHi Nicholas, I would like to thank Kiriakos very much. Our time with him
    was the highlight of our holiday. Kiriakos was an out and out gentleman and very
    knowledgeable, and as we said to him, if we lived in Rhodes, he would certainly
    be our friend. The whole day was perfect. We got to see all that we wanted and
    did not feel at all rushed. The vehicle was very comfortable and of course, we
    had the best driver \U0001F600. <br> As a guide myself, so probably more critical
    than most, I have to say I don’t think it could have been improved upon. The winery
    we wanted to go to was closed but Kiriakos immediately took us to one that was
    open. I know at harvest time, it is not always easy to find wineries open as they
    are too busy. We then had a great lunch, again a place that was recommended by
    Kiriakos. <br> So all in all, 10 out of 10. Thank you for all of your assistance
    and I know that if any of my friends are going to Rhodes, I will definitely recommend
    you and your team. Thank you for a great day. kind regards **Lindsay (Oct 4th)
    Sainte-rose, Reunion**\n\nHi Nicholas, I just want to thank you once again for
    the perfect day we spent in Rhodes. Michael was absolutely perfect and the memories
    that he gave us will last forever. I have posted an amazing review of your company
    and Michael on tripadvisor. I will tell everyone I know how great our experience
    with you was. Thanks again **Jeff (Sept 28th) Canada**\n\nNicholas. It was a TERRIFIC
    day! Perfect in every way!! Everyone loved the day and had a great time. I cannot
    thank you enough for the service, your professionalism and client communication!
    <br> Wishing you all the best always. **Jane (Sept 25th) USA**\n\nHi Nicholas,
    Once again \"Nicholas Rhodes Private Tours\" did not disappoint. We had a wonderful
    day in beautiful Rhodes. Dora was so much fun! Her knowledge on the history of
    Rhodes is incredible. We couldn’t ask for a better driver than Jacob. <br> Thanks
    to you, Dora and Jacob our day in Rhodes was really special. Sincerely, **Susan
    (Sept 24th) USA**\n\nNicholas! I must tell you that our time was fabulous and
    everyone enjoyed it. Michael did a great job of driving us, describing everything,
    answering all of our questions and even taking some group pictures of us together.
    It was a pleasure to meet him. Please convey our best wishes to him for a job
    well done. If we ever return or know of any friends or family visiting Rhodes,
    please know you will get the highest of recommendations! Thank you again for your
    help in arranging the tour, making it easy for us and helping us have a most memorable
    time in Rhodes. <br> Regards, **Mark and Jamie, Miles and Lisa (Sept 23rd) Canada**\n\nThanks
    Nicholas. Dominic was a wonderful driver. I hope to recommend your company and
    hire your services again in the future. <br> Thank you very much **Hiedi (Sept
    23rd) USA**\n\nDear Nicholas and Andrew, We enjoyed the tour today and Andrews
    detailed explanations. Everything went very well as usual. Thank you both and
    take care. We will be back next year. <br> **Vanessa and Steve (Sept 18th) Belgium**\n\nGood
    morning Nicholas! Thank you! We had an excellent time both Tuesday and Thursday
    with Michael and Andrew. We thank you very much for arranging such wonderful days
    and providing tours and itineraries for us to enjoy while in your beautiful island.
    Today is our last day and we are busy doing some last minute sightseeing and packing.
    When we get home I will be sure to post favorable and thorough reviews for you
    as we very very much enjoyed our trips and time with your company and people.
    Thank you again for making our time on Rhodes very special. Memorable. And amazing!!!!
    <br> All the best. **Marcia (13 Sept) Pittsburgh PA USA**\n\nDear Nicholas, Thank

    Dominic was a true professional who went above and beyond to help us enjoy our
    tour. I have already passed on your company’s name to several friends planning
    cruises to Rhodes. <br> **Steve (Sep 8th) San Antonio Texas**\n\nHi Nicholas,
    I hope you are well. I wanted to thank you for our excellent tour. Thank you to
    yourself, Lianna and Yannis for a wonderful day. <br> **Mel (Sept 9th) Ipswich
    Suffolk UK**\n\nDear Nicholas, We feel so fortunate to have spent yesterday with
    your extremely knowledgeable driver Michael! What an appreciation he imparted
    to is for this beautiful island—its history, culture, and people. We will recommend
    \"Rhodes Private Tours\" to every Rhodes-bound person we know!. <br> Warm regards,
    **Patti (Sept 5th) UK**\n\nHi Nicholas, We had the most fabulous day on our tour.
    I promise to write a raving review!!. <br> Best regards **Denise (Sept 1st) New
    Jersey USA**\n\nDear Nicholas, We had such a wonderful day and Dominic was a joy
    to have as our driver and guide. Your island is so beautiful. It was a privilege
    to see it. We will certainly let our friends and family know about this amazing
    island and hope to return to have Dominic as our driver again! <br> Warmest regards
    and many thanks,  \n**Lisa. (Sept 1st) Pikesville Maryland USA**\n\nDear Nicholas,
    Thank you for the service. We loved Stergos, it was wonderful. He gave us a lot
    of insights regarding the island history. And big plus he was so patient with
    the kids. At the end they were sad to leave him. It‘s definitely something we
    would do again or recommend. <br> Ciao, till next time **Christelle (30th Aug)
    Canada**\n\nNicholas, Overall, our family had a great time in Greece. You and
    Andrew were an important part of that success. If we find ourselves back in the
    region, we will not hesitate to call upon your company and gladly refer our friends
    traveling to Rhodes to you. Once again, thank-you very, very much.<br> Best wishes
    and good fortune.  \n**Jeffrey (Aug 28th) Oak Hill Virginia USA**\n\nExcellent
    team, booked via the website and enjoyed the whole Rhodes experience with these

    (Stathis) our driver was awesome. We are looking forward to coming back and will
    pass on your details to our friends :) **Anita and family (Aug 16th) Australia**\n\nWhile
    I was in Rhodes on a cruise, we used Rhodes Private Tours for a beach and island
    tour. Our driver was fantastic and Nicholas made sure we were taken care of all
    day. We went to several beaches and with the suggestion from our driver we chose
    a great beach to enjoy our day in Rhodes. This is a fantastic company! I would
    certainly use them again next time we are in Rhodes.<br> **Kellie (Aug 16th) Chaska

    (August 14th) UK**\n\nGood morning Nicholas! My partner and I had such an amazing
    time on our tour with Mike that I have recommended the same to my parents, who
    are due to visit Rhodes soon. <br> **Pamela (Aug 14th) United Kingdom**\n\nNicholas,
    Wonderful tour, I will definitely give you a great recommendation. Warm regards,
    **Angela (Aug 11th) USA**\n\nDear Nicholas and Michael, Now that I am back in
    Belgium, I can only confirm looking back upon a perfect week on Rhodos - the two
    days I could spend with your company exploring the west coast and Rhodes town
    were equally superb (perfect timing, background information, flexibility - e.g.
    Thari monastery as an extra visit). By means of a private tour I was able to visit
    many highlights of the island in an efficient and peaceful way. I will write a
    positie review on Tripadvisor to support your work!<br> Efcharisto!, **Alain (10th
    Aug) Belgium**\n\nNicholas. Michael was superb on both excursions. We learned
    a lot and had a superb time with him. And you were right regarding Tsambica beach.
    Spectacular.<br> **Joel (Aug 4th) Wilmettte, Illinois, USA**\n\nHi, we really
    enjoyed out time with Manuel and we'll be back again soon. We will not hesitate
    to recommend you.<br> **David (Aug 3rd) USA**\n\nWhat a superb day, an island
    tour with Sergio as our driver, one of the nicest, friendliest and most knowledgeable
    people you could meet. We would recommend Sergio and this company wholeheartedly.
    Thank you for a great day.<br> **Juliet, (Aug 2nd) UK**\n\nThanks so much for
    the tour, Really enjoyed it!<br> **Allan and Amanda, (Aug 2nd) USA**\n\nNicholas
    it was an amazing experience. Thank you so much. We will recommend your services
    again. **Sam and Mary (Aug 2nd) Houston TX USA**\n\nWe were so lucky and fortunate
    to have Michael share the beauty of his lovely island! We spent 8 hours seeing
    all the beauty that Rhodes has to offer and take home memories to last a lifetime!
    Thank you again so much for everything and we hope to see you again upon returning
    to Rhodes. Highly recommended!!!<br> **Mark (Aug 1st) Doraville, Georgia, USA**\n\nHello,
    Thank you for planning for us a wonderful day. Everything went very well and our
    driver was very nice and very knowledgeable. We really enjoyed it. Thank you,
    **Josee (July 27th) Canada**\n\nNicholas, Our tour could not have been any better.
    Mike & Mike were the best! Thanks for your follow up and for having such excellent
    people in your company. Regards, **Mike B. (July 26th) Grand Rapids Michigan US**\n\nDear
    NICHOLAS & MICHAEL, Thank you very much for your kind hospitality and the trip
    was most enjoyable. I will definitely be back in the future for more trips and
    will be sure to spread the word of your great tour experience to friends. Thank
    you very much.<br> Yours sincerely. **E. O. ONYA (July 24th) South Africa**\n\nThanks
    Nicholas to you and Apostolos!!! We spent a great time in Rhodes!!! I had a wonderful
    birthday!<br> Regards, **Monica, (July 23rd) Mexico**\n\nWe had a wonderful day
    in Rhodes. The island is so beautiful, we enjoyed it more than Santorini. Andrew
    was a great tour/driver, and very pleasant to spend the day with. His knowledge
    of Rhodes, and his insight into modern economic and social issues in Greece was
    very informative. So much better than being on a big bus tour from the cruise
    line.<br> **Regards, Susan and Nate (July 22nd) Phoenix Arizona USA**\n\nDear
    Nicholas, Thank you for our tour. We all really enjoyed it and found Kostas the
    tour guide, very friendly and informative. Also Jakob the driver, met us and transported
    us very happily and safely.<br> Kind regards, **Elizabeth (July 21st) USA**\n\nHi
    Nicholas, Thank you so much for the tour especially teaming us up with Mahir.
    He was a great match and very helpful and informative, he knows his job and does
    it very well! The tour itself was also perfect to really see every side of the
    island which is beautiful in itself.  \nWe hope to tour with you again when we
    return to Rhodes and you will be highly recommended to family & friends. Thanks
    again for the tour & many many thanks to Mahir.<br> Kind regards, **Aysel, (July
    18) Australia**\n\nThank you very much! We had a wonderful day yesterday. Michael
    was great showing us all the places. We enjoyed it very much! <br> Thanks, **Subha
    (13 July) UK**\n\nHi Nicholas, Thank you for a truly wonderful day in Rhodes.
    I must state that you are the most professional and considerate tour company owner/manager.
    I appreciated your timely and helpful responses to my questions and requested
    changes to our tour. Please thank Kostas and Jacob. Kostas is absolutely terrific.
    His conservations with us regarding the natural beauty of the island, it’s history
    and just enough about current Greek National issues were captivating. His amusing
    “ Lookie! Lookie! (alerting us to points of interest) should become legendary.
    I will post this to TripAdvisor to help others to find the best tour company ever,
    in our fairly extensive worldwide traveling. <br> Kind regards, **Bill and Daria
    (June 29th) USA**\n\nDominic was truly outstanding and we really enjoyed his company
    and wisdom. We will refer you to friends and to ask for Dominic. Please wish him
    well on the wedding of his son this weekend.<br> **Mark (June 25th) USA**\n\nDear
    Nicholas, I can’t thank you enough for our wonderful day yesterday, Mike is fantastic;
    very knowledgeable and easy to get along with. I honestly can’t think of any way
    to improve the day as it was even better than we’d hoped for. It’s nice to meet
    a business man that cares so much about giving excellent customer service, you
    are a credit to the island<br> Regards, **(June 23rd) Sarah, UK**\n\nNicolas,
    we're home safe and sound. Hope we can send some business your way. Say 'hello'
    to Michael for us. He's the best<br> **Dan (June 20th) Belmont USA**\n\nThank
    you the trip was brilliant .Michael was so informative and cannot comment any
    further on perfection.<br> Kind regards **Jackie and fellow travellers, (June
    16th) West Yorkshire**\n\nGood evening, Thank you for your service. Andrew was
    an awesome driver...very prompt, knowledgeable and friendly. We enjoyed our tour
    very much and appreciate the great communication prior to the trip. I will recommend
    your tours if and when I know someone visiting your beautiful Rhodes. Take good
    care.<br> Many thanks, **Lauren and Sara (June 17th) California USA**\n\nWe had
    the most memorable day of our trip to Greece on our full day tour with Rhodes
    Private Tours. The driver was so knowledgeable and knew exactly how to maximize
    our day. We viewed the Old Harbor, saw where the Aegean and Mediterranean Sea
    meet, drove to the Acropolis of Rhodes and toured south to the clifftop Acropolis
    of Lindos. A drive from the east to the west side of the island capped an exhilarating
    day! A truly rewarding and memorable experience. We will enjoy our pictures and
    think of beautiful Rhodes.<br> **Deb, (June 15th) United States**\n\nWe spent
    a week in Rhodes and one day was taken up with a private tour of the west and
    south sides of the island with our driver Andrew. I would recommend this experience
    to anyone who is not keen on tour buses as it is completely different. You choose
    where you want to go and for how long. We ended the trip with a lovely lunch in
    a friendly local tavern. Definitely 5 stars.<br> **Sue, (June 14th) London England**\n\nThank
    you, we had a great time on the excursion! I will be sure to leave a good review
    on Trip advisor, we had an excellent time!<br> Thanks again, **Best, Josh (June

    (June 6th) Canada**\n\nHi Nicholas, We toured with your company and Manuel was
    great. It was a wonderful tour!!<br> Thanks, **Stephanie, (June 6th) Northborough
    MA**\n\nWe want to let you know what a wonderful tour we had with Kostas and Manolis.
    It was one of the very best highlights of our trip and made us love Rhodes! Kostas
    was so knowledgeable and communicated clearly to us the beauty of Rhodes. He allowed
    the group plenty of time to take pictures and ask questions. He was also very
    entertaining. We could tell Kostas and Manolis has a great relationship. We talked
    about our Rhodes tour for the rest of our trip. We think it was the best tour
    of the entire trip. We feel very fortunate to have found your company. You run
    class act!<br> Sincerely, **Anthony & Mary (June 6th) Gunnison CO**\n\nNicholas:
    thank you for your time & sharing your extensive knowledge. We thoroughly enjoyed
    our day with you. Our lunch was very good as well.<br> Best, **Paola (June 6th)
    USA**\n\nHi Nicholas, I wanted to let you know how much we enjoyed our Rhodes
    tour with Kostas This was the tour booked by Anthony Allen, and we were in that
    small group. Kostas kept us entertained and laughing all day. He was so knowledgeable
    about the history of Rhodes and Greece, and it was fascinating to hear his commentary
    on what we were seeing on the tour. He was very accommodating to our group and
    we enjoyed it very much. In fact, it was our favorite tour of our entire 14 day
    trip.<br> Thank you! **Russ and Barbara (June 5th) USA**\n\nNicholas, You guys
    have gone over and above. We can not thank you enough. We are so appreciative
    of Sergio’s efforts. Thank you both so very much.<br> **Marietta and Family (June
    2nd) Chesapeake Va**\n\nDear Nicholas: Thanks to you and to Michael for a wonderful
    day of touring through Rhodes. We truly had a wonderful time and the weather was
    perfect. Visiting Lindos and the old city of Rhodes was the highlight of the tour.
    The choice of the seafood restaurant for lunch was a good choice. Please thank
    Mike for getting us there and back safely, and for his helpful tips on where to
    go in the old city after our private tour of Rhodes.<br> Regards, **Solideva (June
    2nd) Ottawa**\n\nDear Nicholas, Today was wonderful- truly a highlight of our
    trip. Yannis did a great job and we learned so much. We loved everything we did

    say thank you for making this possible.<br> Kind regards, **Gail and Alan (May
    30th) Atlanta Georgia USA**\n\nHi Nicholas. Please thank Michael for such a lovely
    tour experience. Michael was really informative and we had many questions for
    him, and he answered them all! It was nice having flexibility with the tour. We
    weren't too interested in visiting any churches, but it was great to stop in to
    a pottery place and watch the man making it, and buying a special treat for ourselves
    to take home. The other good thing was that it was very easy to book this tour
    with you, Nicholas, on-line - and that everything went very smoothly. Thank you
    so much for your care and attention to detail. I hope Michael is well, and trust
    that he will be busy with your Summer tourists!<br> Very kind regards, **Katrina
    and David (May 29th) New Zealand**\n\nThank you Nicholas and Michael. and I had
    a great time on the tour. I will be sure to write a good online review of your

    good, and he makes sure you get to see and experience the best Rhodes has to offer...!
    Highly recommend him as a Knowledgeable Driver...!!! Thank you once again, and

    Nicholas. We just wanted to let you know we had a great tour with driver Michael.
    He did a great job showing us the highlights of Rhodes! We really enjoyed our
    stop at the Olive Oil Factory and all the photo stops! I would highly recommend
    your company to anyone who is looking for a tour. Michael's restaurant suggestion
    for lunch was also great!<br> Thanks again! **Greg and Roseanne (May 18th) Phoenix
    AZ USA**\n\nNicholas, We had a great time on the island, truly beautiful. Good
    vehicle, driver and guide. Loved Kostas, he was fantastic, just the type of guide
    we like. Interesting, Knowledgeable, Theatrical and Thoughtful. I will remember
    him, and that makes a good guide. Say hello from Mark. The group was even doing
    his look..look...look...OPA! on other islands. Will be back with \"Rhodes Private
    Tours\" when we come again!<br> Thanks for all your help.<br> **Mark St. (May
    17th) California**\n\nThank you. Sergio was great and the service was great. We
    will recommend you to others.<br> **Howard (May 17th) Canada**\n\nSergio was a
    wonderful driver who had a wealth of knowledge about the sites we visited and
    was very accommodating to our interests and needs. The visit to Lindos was marvelous.
    He showed us views of this acropolis from various vantage points before we began
    our climb.<br> Leora, (May 16th) USA\n\nAndrew was wonderful, extremely knowledgeable
    and gave us plenty of time to take in the sights in a relaxed environment. Can’t
    wait to return to Rhodes and highly recommend Rhodes Private Tours.<br> Thank
    you, **Amy (May 15th) Boca Raton Florida USA**\n\nWe were going to be on a Mediterranean
    cruise and this was my husbands first time in Europe, so I researched the tours
    to try and find the best one. We were certainly not disappointed. The communications
    with Nicholas was great all along. We asked him to modify the tour as I need a
    knee replacement and can't do a lot of walking. He took us to some of the most
    incredible sites. The attention to everything was just wonderful. He even went
    so far as to help my husband put his feet in the ocean and then helped him put
    his shoes back on. Just an incredible extra touch.<br> Please do yourself a favor
    and book your tour with Nicholas and his team<br> **Jim and Laura, (May 15th)**
    Streamwood\n\nHello, We are home now and writing reviews. We want to thank you
    for a wonderful day. We had such a great time on Rhodes and learned a lot. If
    we come again someday we will call you.<br> Sincerely, **Deborah and Gordon (May
    14th) Melbourne Florida USA**\n\nThanks so much for the tour, it was brilliant.
    Everyone, especially Layla had a great time.<br> **Rajesh,(May 14th) UK**\n\nAwesome
    Service!! They were 20 feet from the boat gangway waiting from us! Driver was
    super nice and always left us right at the entrance of all the attractions. Also
    he picked the best picture spots. Much better than the ship excursion at half
    the price. Highly recommended!!!!<br> **Antonio (May 14) Piso Cabo San Lucas**\n\nNicholas,
    I posted positive reviews on tripadvisor and Facebook. Michael was the best driver.
    Hoping in the near future to come again and see more of Rhodes. Michael was fantastic!<br>
    **Leslie Baker (May 14th) Beer Sheva Israel**\n\nDear Nicholas, We were very happy
    with our tour experience with Emmanouel Papachristofis. He was an excellent and

    it was great to meet you. Thank you for a great day!!<br> **Alexandra (May 2nd)
    San Diego CA USA**\n\nNicholas, Thank you for arranging a great tour. Yannis was
    a fantastic guide. Very knowledgeable, very friendly and interesting, very good
    English and a safe driver. I will post a very positive review on TripAdvisor;
    most likely not until next week when we return to California. Thank you for meeting
    us at the pier; it was a pleasure to meet you in person after having corresponded
    with you for a few months on e-mail.<br> **Howard (May 1st) USA**\n\nDear Nicholas,
    Thanks for your tour. we truly enjoyed the tour guide \"Costas\" and all the knowledge
    he shared.<br> Thank you, **Adrian(April 28th) USA**\n\nDear Nicholas, we really
    enjoy our stay in Rhodes. Michael show us many place even if in a short time and
    gave us a lot of interesting information. Thanks him again from us and thank you
    for your assistance.<br> All the best **Michele (April 25th) Rome, Italy**\n\nNicholas,
    Thank you sooo much! We thoroughly enjoyed our time with you. The picture you
    took of us at the winery was perfect!<br> **Laurie (April 24th) New Zealand**\n\nNicholas,
    Thank you so much for a wonderful day on your amazing island. My only regret was
    that we were not in port longer. Kostas and Jacob did an amazing job. I can’t
    wait to return!<br> Best wishes and Happy Easter!<br> **Piper (April 24th) Florida
    USA**\n\nHi Nicholas, I am sorry for the delay in writing the review, I just took
    care of it, you will find it under Maria Kay. Thank you again for the wonderful

    (April 15) Amsterdam**\n\nDear Nicholas, Just wanted to say what a wonderful time
    we all had seeing the beautiful island of Rhodes . Coming into port none of us
    had much expectations from it but Thanks to Manuel and his annexdotes we all saw
    it through a fresh vision. He is an amazing driver and was a wonderful guide to
    us. We plan to revisit Rhodes, this time to stay on the island.<br> I'll pass
    on your information to my family and friends. It was a pleasure working with professionals
    like your team.<br> **Thank You,<br> Supriya (April 12) New Berlin WI USA**\n\nHi
    Nicholas! We've made it back to the states but couldn't be happier that we were
    able to spend time with you in Rhodes, it was really one of the highlights of
    our entire trip. You gave such a great tour, and it really helped us to truly
    appreciate the island. I just submitted our review on TripAdvisor. We will be
    recommending Rhodes and you to all our friends.<br> Thanks again! **Annie (Feb

    Nicholas, we had a wonderful day visiting the island of Rhodes. Our driver was great and we enjoyed every minute of our tour. Thank you so much!!<br> **Marlene K. (Dec 28th) Indianapolis IN US**

    Hi Nicholas, We are still in the ship and I will do a full review but Kostas was wonderful. We enjoyed our day and were grateful for his knowledge and wonderful sense of humor and to learn so many Greek words. Please say hello for us.<br> Kalimera, **Phyllis (Nov 25th) USA**

    Nicholas and Michael, What a wonderful half day we spent with Michael taking us around Rodos and Lindos. We and ours friends learned a great deal about the beautiful island you shared on this journey. You were so accommodating and willing to adjust your tour to meet our time restrictions and things we wanted to see. This was a very special day you created for the four of us and will be one of our highlights of this trip. Michael, we came as strangers and left friends! Very special! Thank you!!<br> **Steve and Cheryl (Nov 20th) USA**

    Thank you so much. We had a wonderful time with Kostas. He was a fabulous tour guide. I will be posting to TripAdvisor with a very positive recommendation.<br> **Bev R. (Nov 19th) California USA**

    Thank you, Nicholas. Our small group of 6 persons loved our tour with Liana and Jacob. We were blessed to have such wonderful weather for so late in the year. Our connections with you once we arrive on the Seabourn Ovation were perfect. Everything worked as planned.<br> Thank you for all. **Liz B. (Nov 17th) Southlake**

    Dear Nicholas - we all had a great time on our tour - and fell in love with Rhodes! Stathis was an amazing driver and courteously provided us answers to all our questions. We felt like he really "took care of us." I will highly recommend your services to anyone contemplating a visit to Rhodes. Our best to Stathis!! **Marianne S. (Nov 13th) UK**

    We had a phenomenal day with our driver, Gianis(John). He spoke perfect English and was very enthusiastic about all the historical sights including the Village and Acropolis of Lindos, Anthony Quinn Bay, the old and new town, the Holocaust Memorial, and much more.<br> Highly recommend Nicholas Rhodes Private Tours.<br> **Arnie and Elaine, ( Nov 12th) Los Angele CA USA**

    Hi Nicholas, We all had a fabulous day and experienced so much in such a short time. Stamos was informative, cheerful and flexible. He went out of his way to make our day enjoyable. Thank you so much to both of you.<br> Kind Regards **(Nov 8th) Carolyn, Steve, Lynne & John, New Australia**

    Hello Nicholas, One of the others from the tour group asked me if I knew the tour was going to be this good when I booked it and of course I said yes!! Truthfully my wife and I have probably been on 10 cruises and I don't know how many tours but I would have to say this one was the best ever!! Our guide Kostas, and driver Jacob were the best, full of knowledge and humor.<br> Hopefully we can return to Rhodes sometime.<br> Thanks again! **(Nov 6th) Melvin & LaVonne, Williston/North Dakota/USA**

    Hi Nicholas, It was so great to finally meet you. Yes, we thoroughly enjoyed our day with Manuel - he was great! He shared lots of stories with us which is what we were looking for. He also shared his umbrellas with us which we were very grateful for! We very much enjoyed Rhodes and thought it would be a great place visit again. If we decide to come back, I will certainly be in contact with you again for your insight & thoughts on the best places to stay. Thanks again,<br> Your Canadian friends, **Carol T. (Nov 4th) Canada**

    Dear Nicholas, We thoroughly enjoyed touring with you. Rhodes is beautiful island. We were talking about it at dinner tonight. Who knows, maybe we'll make another trip here in the future. We will go home with wonderful memories of our time touring with you.<br> Thanks again. **Norma (Nov3rd) USA**

    Nicholas, We had a wonderful time with Mike and Manuel. Very informative and very good drivers!!!<br> Thanks so much, **Arthur W. (Nov 3rd) Canada**

    Hi Nicholas, It was a pleasure meeting you as well!<br> Thanks again!<br> **Marianne (Nov 2nd) Toronto Canada**

    Loved Rhodes so much I wanted to move there. We were taken around by the owner Nicholas. He was so wonderful. Highly recommend asking for him specifically<br> **Andrés & Marilee (Nov 2nd) New Mexico**

    Hi Nicholas: The tour was amazing and we loved Kostas and Jacob. Thanks so much for your help in planning this tour. I will write recommendations on TripAdvisor.<br> **Elaine and Gary (Nov 2nd) Plano TX**

    Dear Nicholas, We have arrived home and I now have time to let you know how much our group loved the time we spent in Rhodes. Stergos was a wonderful driver. We learned so much about Rhodes and felt that we received a wonderful overview of your beautiful island. Unfortunately for us we only had one day to spend in Rhodes. I'm sure there is so much more to discover and hopefully we will be back some day. Please send Stergos our very best regards.<br> Sincerely, **Suzanne (Oct 27th) United States**

    Hi Nicholas, the tour was great! TripAdvisor review coming soon! **Robert, ( Oct 26th) Pensacola, FL**

    Comfy drive, amazing sights, brilliant company (despite the rain!).<br> My husband and I took a tour of Rhodos Medieval city and Lindos with Nick. He was a very knowledgeable driver who clearly has a passion for the history of the island.<br> We began in the old town and saw some really amazing sights. Leaving early in the morning meant that we missed all the crowds and were really able to soak in the atmosphere.<br> We then headed out to Lindos with a stop en route at a local pottery place. The rain caught up with us but that didn't dampen the mood!<br> After a walk around and a drink we headed for something to eat at the most wonderful restaurant on the sea. Nick recommended some Greek Dishes that we're just delicious.<br> The tour lasted for 6 hours but Nick was completely flexible to our needs and went above and beyond to ensure that we got what we wanted from our excursion.<br> **Victoria (Oct 23rd) UK**

    Nicholas, We enjoyed our tour very much! Liana and Jacob were wonderful!<br> Thank you!, **Jayni, (Oct 22nd) Minden Ontario Canada**

    Nicholas & Michael, We would like to thank you for our tour of Rhodes. We also really enjoyed our day on Rhodes and hope to come back and stay for longer so we can really explore your beautiful island. I can only say good things about our driver Michael. He was extremely knowledgeable. He showed us many things and was also very flexible and lovely. We wish you all the best and look forward to touring with you when we are able to come back. We will certainly recommend your services to any of our friends who are coming to Rhodes.<br> Kind regards, **Doula & Wayne, (Oct 23rd) Australia**

    Nicholas, We had a lovely day thank you - I have submitted a very well deserved 5 star trip advisor review - please pass on our thanks to Andrew.<br> Kind Regards, **Sandra, (Oct 22nd) USA**

    Michael did a GREAT job of showing us around Rhodes! He picked us up right at our ship, the Seabourn Odyssey! He showed us the Rhodes gates and windmills and then on the way to Lindos, he made several stops for beautiful views! Anthony Quinn Bay was breathtaking! He shared so many wonderful stories and knowledge about Rhodes. For lunch, he picked a place that now after the trip, we can say was our favorite restaurant on the trip - Argos - right on the water. The food and service were spectacular!<br> **Dana (Oct 22nd), Lady Lake**

    Really wonderful tour.... excellent driver... enjoyed it immensely<br> Marie and Robert, (21st Oct) Australia

    Thank you so much Nicholas! We enjoyed your company and knowledge, and the beauty of Rhodes.<br> We will review you on Trip Advisor and with Maggie.<br> All the best to you...**Steve and Marianne (Oct 21st) Canada**

    Nicholas, We loved your Island! The tour was fabulous and Manuel was such a great host. We will definitely recommend you to friends who may go to Rhodes!<br> Thank you, **Ray and Ruth Ann (Oct 20th) Marietta GA USA**

    Nicholas, Our visit to Rhodes was spectacular, and your service helped make it so! Manuel was so very kind to us and we appreciated him tremendously. (I really learned a lot about olive oil.)<br> We really did not know much about Rodos prior to our visit, and so we were pleasantly surprised with the beauty of the island. We especially enjoyed our visit to Lindos. We have many beautiful photos to remind us of the trip, but we would really like to visit again and spend more time next time.<br> Thank you and Manuel again for such a wonderful day.<br> Sincerely, **George, (Oct 20th) Belton**

    We took a tour of the island of Rhodes including Lindos with Dominic. He was a very knowledgeable driver who clearly has a passion for the history of the island. Being a native of Rhodes he shared numerous great stories about the island from a local perspective. We were on a cruise, so had a short time on the island. Leaving early in the morning meant that we missed all the crowds and were really able to soak in the atmosphere. We drove to several sites around the old town area then headed out to Lindos with a stop en route at a local pottery/olive oil place. After a walk around Lindos and a drink we headed for something to eat at a great restaurant on the sea. The tour lasted for around 7 hours.<br> **Mark, (Oct 20th) SAN ANTONIO Texas US**

    Thank you Nicholas.<br> I will be happy to refer my friends and acquaintances to your service. We really enjoyed the tour.<br> **Christine, (Oct 19th) Canada**

    I would highly recommend "Nicholas Rhodes Private Tours". Michael was our driver. His English is very good, and he is highly intelligent and knowledgeable of everything in Rhodes. He made our private tour very enjoyable and informed. Michael showed us first the "Best of Rhodes" outside the old town and then to Lindos and back. His personality really made our trip to Rhodes very memorable. Again, we would highly recommend using him for your private tour. Their pricing is very reasonable as well.<br> **William and Mary, (Oct 18th) Bullard Texas**

    Dear Nicholas, We loved our driver Michael. We were impressed by his knowledge and the way he explained the cultural facts about Rhodes. We loved Rhodes! We will be sure to recommend your tour company to our friends who come to Rhodes in the future.<br> Thank you for a great day and please send our regards to Michael.<br> **Herb and Fredi (Oct 16th) Pomona New York**

    What a wonderful tour of Rhodes by Mike as our driver. We arrived by cruise ship and only had a few hours on this beautiful island. . . . and Mike did his best to give a an amazing tour. He picked us up at ship side and we were off! Mike is Very knowledgeable of Rhodes history and culture. and provided interesting dialogue We traveled through city, to countryside, ruins, beaches, and many stops along the way. We ended our tour in Old Town with walking and some shopping.<br> Thank You Mike for a great day! and Thank You Nicholas for ease in reservation-excellent communication and great service!<br> **Diane, (Oct 16th) Vadnais Heights Minnesota USA**

    The entire team was amazing. We had a wonderful tour of the countryside and wine tasting. Our cruise ship had to change ports and they were able to accommodate this change with less than 14 hours’ notice. Our driver was very knowledgeable and did a great job. We had an amazing authentic lunch at a very reasonable price. Thank you to Rhodes Private Tours for showing us what makes this island so special.<br> **Eileen (Oct 16th) Cypress**

    We travel with two other couples, Nicholas handled every detail to perfection from inquiry to the completion of our day. What a blessed experience spending the day with Leana! We will definitely be back to enjoy this welcoming and delightful island and its people.<br> **Arden (15th Oct) Aptos CA USA**

    My organization booked a Knights of St John tour in Rhodes for October 2018. The booking process was very easy and communication on tour content was fantastic. The guide for our day, Liana, was so warm, friendly, knowledgeable and generous with our group. The tour was organized impeccably and Rhodes Private tours clearly were eager to ensure that the tour contained everything our organization was wanting to see. They checked with us constantly that we were happy and they altered and added things on the go if we showed interest in certain areas over others. We were all blown away by the knowledge and professionalism of our guide and on a personal note, we all warmed to Liana so much- she really brought heart and soul to the tour, helping us to understand culture, and an element of spiritual belief of the area as well as throughout history. We all highly recommend Rhodes Private Tours and Liana as a perfect Rhodes guide. Thank you.<br> **Belinda (14th Oct) Australia**

    From the first email to our good byes, our experience was one of the most memorable we have ever had. Nicholas responded quickly and we tailored a personal itinerary that included a tour of the entire island. Stergos, our guide, was simply wonderful, knowledgeable, and flexible. Traveling across the mountains we stopped and picked some of the grapes that were being harvested! We stopped at a family owned ceramic shop to visit with the owner and his family, and we saw him making the pottery! We stopped for lunch at a small seaside restaurant, Argos, for a simply delicious seafood delight. We visited a winery and sampled wines. We traveled roads the busses cannot, and saw intimate and serene coves and beaches. The trip was ours, we could modify it as we went along. We even booked a list minute trip to the valley of the butterflies. Nicholas called to make sure our trip was going well, and further checked in with is during our two weeks in Rhodes. Would highly recommend Nicholas and his team. Next year we will be in Rhodes, cruise stop for a day, and will definitely make arrangements to tour with them! Thank you Nicholas and team for a memorable trip to Rhodes.<br> **Chrisanthy and James (Oct 14th) USA**

    Hello again. !I wanted to say thank you so much for the wonderful tour! Professional, comfortable, knowledgeable, funny and compassionate. I would highly recommend your business in the future. The tour was just enough of the area for my daughter and I. Beautiful areas and great stories. My daughter got quite fussy and Michael was great! Joking and trying to make her cheer up. There was even a secret surprise for her at the end of the day!!<br> Thank you and Michael for a lasting impression and memories!<br> **Suzi (Oct 13th) GodManchester**

    We had a lovely day with Nicholas who gave us a great overview of the island. We went to places where the tour busses do not go and met some lovely locals along the way. Highlights included the lovely spot where we had a glorious lunch and a family owned pottery who have made pots for several generations. Nothing was too much trouble and we would not hesitatate to book with this company again<br> **Warren and Carol, (Oct 12th) Australia**

    Hi Nicholas, We very much liked our tour and Stathis was fantastic. When I get home, I will post a review on TripAdvisor. <br> Thanks again<br> **Vanessa (Oct 9th) Australia**

    Nicholas,This was a truly amazing day. We thoroughly enjoyed Mike and everything he showed us. Definitely one of the top tours of our cruise.<br> I also want to say how impressed I am with your personal customer service, beginning with meeting us at the port to introduce us to our driver. Your follow up call during the tour was also much appreciated. You can be assured I will pass along your name and email address when asked for a recommendation on what to do when visiting Rhodes.<br> Thanks! **Bob (Oct 5th) USA**

    Nicholas, Thanks for a great tour of Rhodes. Manuel was full of knowledge of island history and also the best spots for pictures. We will recommend your tour to any friends traveling to Rhodes. (Oct 5th)<br> Thanks for a wonderful day. **Dave, (Oct 5th) Roseville**

    Dear Nicholas, It was a great day. Kostas and Jacob were delightful. You have a top notch operation and a beautiful interesting country. I wish I could have seen more.<br> Thank you, **Ginny (Oct 4th) CanadA**

    Dear Nicholas, We were very pleased with our tour. Mike took lots of time to let us see everything and was very knowledgeable. We felt we saw and learned a lot. The place chosen for lunch was excellent. We would have no hesitation in recommending your company and Mike as a driver in particular.<br> Thank you, **Nick and Marnie (Oct 3rd) Canada**

    Nicholas, Thank you for providing such a wonderful tour! Michael was excellent! We really enjoyed the Jewish Quarter and the synagog. The weather was perfect and our lunch at Argo could not have been better. We loved Rhodes! We will be stopping here next year when we cruise to Israel. I will be contacting you so we can see more of your beautiful island. Again, thank you for a wonderful day!<br> **Susan (Oct 3rd) Palm Harbor Florida USA**

    We did 2 four hour detailed morning tours. We had two different very helpful and knowledge drivers who owned the business. I am disabled and they provided a large Mercedes to take my travel scoot in the boot. Well worth it to see all the top spots in 8 hours with stops for views and a taverna lunch. Make the trips from your own list if you want to. Superb way to go<br> **Greg (Oct 2nd) Colwyn Bay UK**

    Hi Nicholas, We really enjoyed our tour of Rhodes. It was one of our favorite places in Greece, beautiful with a fascinating history, and we learned so much from our guide, John, about Greece's past and present. Loved being able to go into Lindos and get off the beaten path at the peaceful seaside restaurant. Hope we can return someday to see more.<br> **Kathy & John (Oct 1st) Huddleston Virginia USA**

    Dear Nicholas, Thank you again. We are full of motions and feelings even we are in the office now every day. Many greetings for you, Michael and his family.<br> **Renata and family, (Sept 29th) Czech**

    We really enjoyed our day with Michael! So happy the weather cooperated! Such a beautiful island! Thanks for your flexibility with the ship change.<br> **Leanne, Keith, Debbie, David ( Sept 29th) Cary NC USA**

    Wonderful day. Andrew was excellent. Many thanks.<br> **Martin (Sept 28th) USA**

    I highly recommend this company. We booked this tour when our cruise ship changed ports to stop at Rhodes. Nicholas promptly answered my email and gave an excellent description of what we would see and options for extension for a reasonable price. Our driver, Sergio, was waiting for us on the pier right as we got off the ship. He was so friendly and knowledgeable. Sergio knew right where to park for easy access to sights and excellent views. His explanations were concise and very interesting. We would never have been able to see all these sights on a big group tour.<br> Thank you, **Eillen (Sept 28th) Wayne NJ USA**

    Nick, You are entirely welcome! We enjoyed the day immensely. What a great way to see Rhodes! And, our stop for lunch was like something out of a dream. Perfect setting, wonderful hosts and fantastic and seaside fresh meal! Many thanks and we'll pass along some similar comments on Trip Advisor. Our best to you and your family.<br> Greg (Sept 27th) Kendall Park New Jersey USA

    Nicholas,. The tour was very enjoyable. The restaurant for lunch was delightful.<br> Thank you, **Robert, (Sept 26th) UK**

    We were lucky enough to have both Nick and Michael on the two days we visited and were not disappointed. A wonderful way to see Rhodes! Would 100% use Rhodes private tours again, couldn't recommend it enough!!<br> **Jan (Sept 25th) Canada**

    Nicholas, we loved the tour. Thank you.<br> **Eileen( Sept 24th) Australia**

    Dear Nicholas, We had such a wonderful day tour & all we can say is to continue with what you are doing.

We will make a highly recommended comment on TripAdvisor for Rhodes Private Tours.<br> Thank you once again for making our holiday in Rhodes, so very special.<br> Regards, **Vicki & Edward (Sept 21st) USA**

    We were only in Rhodes a few days and staying south of Lindos so we decided to take a tour of Rhodes town and other sites. Stergos was a great driver. Very intelligent, warm and informed of all things Rhodos!<br> Grant (Sept 18th) Vancouver

    Nicolas Great tour . Dominic was a font of knowlege and we really enjoyed the sights and a wonderful restaurant recommendation in Lindos .<br> Thanks for your help Regards, **John (Sept 17th) Bermuda**

    Nick, Manuel packed in a lot to see in s a few short hours. He was helpful and knowledgeable.<br> Both couples appreciated your flexibility for a later start time.

I have already given your name to others who might come to Rhodes.<br> Regards, **Alan and Janis, Harry and Marylou (Sept 15th) USA**

    We had a fabulous day with Andrew! He did a great job showing us around Rhodes. You have a very professional business! Thank you so much! I will, most certainly, keep your name for my future clients when they visit Rhodes!<br> Thank you! **Dave and Debbie (Sept 13) Winnebago**

    Eight people in our party were greeted by Manuel and Stathis in two Mercedes vehicles as soon as we stepped off our ship. Our drivers were very informative and stopped several times for us to take photos. We visited several wineries with great wines and we stopped for a delicious lunch. It was very easy to book and communicate with Rhodes Private Tours. It was a wonderful day and a beautiful place to visit.<br> **Dawn (Sept 13) Manassas Virginia USA**

    Nicholas, I can't express how much we enjoyed our tour of beautiful Rhodes and wonderful driver Michael. He was so thoughtful. Your island was more beautiful than we expected. We loved the restaurant by the sea. If any of our friends come to Greece I will definitely recommend you. Thank you again and it was especially nice of you to call and come to the port to meet us,<br> Regards **Linda, Bob, Pat & Larry(Sept 12th) USA**

    What a day! We spent the day with Andrew. And what a day it was. We saw historical sites and views that boggles the mind and senses. We started the tour at 8:00am and were always one stop ahead of the big tour groups - thanks to Andrew. Rhodes Private Tours delivered a spectacular day. We will recommend this tour to our family and friends. Thank you Nicholas and Andrew!<br> **Bev & Ron (Sept 9th) Australia**

    Nicholas, Thank you so much for making our vacation so enjoyable with such great memories of Rhodes! My family and I can't thank you enough for the wonderful day. My son and daughter in law have already told everyone on Facebook what a fantastic day we had. We loved the island, but especially appreciated Kostas' love of the island and thorough knowledge of the history that he shared with us. We will highly recommend you to all of our traveling friends. Nick and Kim are giving you glowing reviews on Trip Advisor as well. We loved every moment of our day!<br> Sincerely, **Diane & family (Sept 5th) Poulsbo Washington USA**

    Hi Nicholas- We had a fantastic time on our wine tour. Andrew was very punctual and a wealth of knowledge! He was able to show us to many of the famous historical sites and ensured we had many pictures to remember our vacation! At the wineries he was able to help us navigate through the different types of wine so that we were able to try a bit of everything. Andrew was a great driver and made us feel very comfortable to ask questions. We enjoyed this tour and would highly recommend Andrew for future tours.<br> Thank you for a great day! **Sara (Aug 27th) UK**

    Nicholas, I enjoyed the tour very much and look forward to taking the next tour as soon as I can.<br> Best regards, **Shaun (Aug 26th) Germany**

Michael was extremely knowledgeable, professional, and a very safe and talented driver.<br> Thanks to both of you! **Tracy (Aug 14th) Germany**

    I used Trip Advisor to search for a private tour company that could arrange a tour for 6 seniors. Rhodes Private Tours operated by Nicholas Rhodes was highly recommended. I emailed Nicholas prior to booking for his suggestions and recommendations. He was quick to respond! He answered all of my questions and was VERY knowledgeable about Rhodes.<br> Our tour guide Kosta made this tour unforgettable. It was a special day with a special guide that will never be forgotten. Without a doubt, this private tour on Rhodes was the VERY BEST<br> My friends, if you are looking for THE BEST tour in Rhodes , search no more . Book Rhodes Private Tours NOW and more importantly request Kosta as your guide. YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID !<br> **Aron (Aug 4th) USA**

    This is a belated review. My family and I (a group of 6 people) travelled to Rhodes and we were so glad that I booked a private tour with Nicolas.<br> Nicolas was very professional, knowledgeable and fun as a tour guide. We totally enjoyed the off-the-beaten-path routes that he choose for us and we enjoyed the tour with him.<br> As a traveller, I certain would recommend other travelers use Nicolas' services, particularly if you only have limited time in Rhodes.<br> **Sumalee (Aug 3rd) Canada**

    Nicholas, Yesterday all ok. Also Manuel is a good driver and we are appreciate his service<br> Thanks, **Filiberto, ( Aug 2nd) Italy**

    We toured Rhodes while on our cruise recently and had a very great experience. Nicholas, the owner, introduced himself before we left, called and spoke with me to ensure we were happy during the 1st half of the tour. Our driver was Manual and he's very knowledgeable and professional. We saw many sights but especially enjoyed the restaurant he took us to add well as the pottery stop.<br> We would highlight recommend this company.<br> **Kris (July 30th) Salem**

    Had a great time. Perfect driver and day...<br> **Don (July 26th) Woodsboro MD USA**

    The time we spent with Nicholas was like being with a close friend. He greeted us with a warm smile and we liked him immediately and felt very comfortable. We felt like we knew him for years. When he asked us where we wanted to go, we asked him to take us to places he would take friends and relatives from America. It was a truly delightful, relaxing, insightful day and we felt we saw the highlights of Rhodes.

    Yes, our memories of Rhodes are wonderful. I will convey your greetings to the other couple as soon as get unpacked. It will probably be after Christmas, but I also intend to write up our excursion with you on Trip Advisor. “Don’t miss a trick, travel with Nick.” Best wishes, **Jean and Ralph (Dec 15th) Greensboro North Carolina USA**

    This was a welcome reprieve from the packed commercialized bus stop tours we had done on other islands. What we experienced was an intimate, personalized, very knowledgeable driver. Our driver was incredible! His love of Rhodes shone through, he catered to our personal interests and challenged our boundaries a bit by showing us some new things about the island. He took us to a quiet beautiful restaurant where the locals eat….. Excellent day! **Annita (Dec 12) Marana Arizona USA**

    Thank you Nicholas. We got back home last night from our cruise. Tsambika was an excellent guide and everyone on our tour loved her. You have a very beautiful island and we were glad to be able to visit it. Have a very Merry Christmas. **Dave & Ann (Nov 28) Port St. Lucie Florida**

    Dear Nicholas, All of our family members who went on the tour of Rhodes with your drivers, Mike and Dominic, were completely delighted with their visit. The cruise ships give visitors a limited time in Rhodes, and we cannot imagine a better way to spend that time than to tour the island with your company. We were able to see many things and beautiful sites at our own pace; the tour/drivers were very knowledgeable guides, and the lunch at the restaurant was quite excellent. We appreciate your personal attention to our group, and if we return to Rhodes in the future, we would be delighted to work with your company again. Thanks very much, **James and Margaret M. (Oct 30th) Louisville, Kentucky**

    Hi Nicholas, I wanted to let you know how much we enjoyed our time on Rhodes last month and what an excellent job Manuel did as our guide. I found you all to be very easy to work with from the booking process through our time touring the island. The phone call from you via Manuel after we arrived was an excellent touch and it was nice of you to take the time to introduce yourself when our tours overlapped during the day. You really understand that the little touches make for a great customer experience. I’ve told several people about the great job you do and just completed a review on Trip Advisor. Thanks again for making our all too brief time on Rhodes an awesome experience! **Harvey W (May 21st) Austin, Texas**

    Nicholas, Michael was a great drive. The couple that joined us for the tour really enjoyed themselves also. It was just right for our needs.

All the best, **Matt (May 20th) Kentucky US**

    following our wonderful holiday in Rhodes. Although our main aim was to have some
    sunshine and relaxation, we just wanted to thank you very much indeed for the
    brilliant half day tour you took us on. We thoroughly enjoyed it and particularly
    liked the fact that you managed to enable us to see so much in such a short time
    frame. Your local knowledge of the area enabled us to see things that we would
    otherwise have taken hours to find and we particularly enjoyed your \"mini-history\"
    lesson and all of the interesting information you shared with us. We will definitely
    recommend you to others as being the most enjoyable way to explore the island.
    Your air conditioned Mercedes was also very much appreciated and offered some
    respite from the heat! We have some wonderful memories to look back on from all
    the photos you took of us whilst on the tour -- many thanks again and we hope
    to see you again in the future.<br>\nBest wishes<br>\nMaxine Banks (July 1st)<br>\nSenior

    of Rhodes and hospitality of its people.<br>\nIf we are ever to visit Rhodes again,
    we would go back to that small family bakery for their croissants- they are as
    good as in Paris:)<br>\nAlso, next time, instead of the ruins, we would head straight
    to Rhodes beautiful beaches!<br>\nBest regards,<br>\nAngelica Kochetova (June

    We make a point of largely thanking you for the splendid private tour for Rhodos
    with Auguste, this private tour in French language was largely appreciated. Auguste
    was an extraordinary guide with a largely appreciated professionalism. Monsieur
    Auguste was really very nice with us. We spent a very beautiful moment at the
    time of our beautiful visit of the island of Rhodes.<br>\nThank you very much,<br>\nJean-Yves

    Nicholas, Yes it was a very good tour despite my mother not being very well!<br>\nPlease
    pass on my thanks to Michael, who was very kind to her. It didn't make the tour
    very easy for him but he still gave us his best!!<br>\nI would have no hesitation
    in recommending your services, Michael's knowledge of your beautiful island's
    history was amazing!<br>\nMaire Kealy (June 14th)<br>\nmairekealy@gmail.com\n\nRhodes
    was the 6th stop on our cruise. We used Rhodes Private Tours. They gave us a 4
    ½ hour tour (we actually extended it an additional hour).The tour/driver Dominic
    never stopped talking about this beautiful island and we were so impressed with
    all the information he gave us. I heartily recommend this service. We saw so much
    more than we would have on a bus. I would use them again if I ever get back to
    Rhodes.<br>\nRick Hoover (June 12th)<br>\nLake Oswego, Oregon<br>\nickhoover1950@cableone.net\n\nNicholas,thank

    was fantastic mainly because of our driver Manuel. He was the best guide we had
    on our entire trip, and we took over 12 shore excursions on our trip. My wife
    thought Greece was the best country we visited, and we visited nine other countries.
    I am sure she felt that way primarily because of Manuel. We enjoyed every sight
    he brought us to. I hope someday we have the opportunity to revisit Greece.<br>\nThanks
    again for all your efforts.<br>\nJohn and Sharon Hanton (May 8th)<br>\njohnhmtn@gmail.com\n\nNicholas.

    Hello Nicholas, The tour you gave us was the highlight of our trip. Rhodes is a spectacular island and your deep knowledge of its history was appreciated by all. The trip to the winery was special.<br>
    Who knew we could fit so much sightseeing into 5 hours.<br>
    If you ever come to the USA please come west to San Diego. We will meet you here and return your hospitality.<br>
    Thank you for a great time. Rhodes Private Tours is simply the best way to see the island of Rhodes.<br>

    Hi Nicholas, I just wanted to drop you an email to commend the driver we had on our recent tour of Rhodes. Mick was fantastic. He not only provided great information on Rhodes but was very personable. We went searching for the remains of my Grandmother's family home in Gennadio and thanks to Mick, we also found living relatives. Mick was able to translate our conversation (as we do not speak the language). It was a day that we will never forget, finding the first cousin's of my mother and being able to converse, through Mick, made our day. One of the most special days of our lives. Without Mick we would not have inquired at the local store, found the relatives and been able to communicate with the relatives. We were also appreciative that Mick was able to extend the tour time we had to change from a half day to a full day. Great service!!!!<br>

    Dear Nicholas, Just wanted to let you know what an outstanding job our tour driver - Michael did for us. Seeing Rhodes on a private tour and stopping for the length of time at places that we wanted to - and at the end going up to the highest peak to the monastery made it worthwhile to pay for the additional hour added to our half day tour of Rhodes. Your services gave us a good reason to want to come again to Rhodes and stay longer next time! Thank you for the great day we had and give Michael a raise - he did a great job! :)<br>
    All the Best,<br>

    Dear Nicholas, I can't believe the trip is over--it was really packed, but we saw so many beautiful places. I loved Rhodes, especially the views from the cliffs. It is also very special to see a place through the eyes of someone who lives there. God willing, I will come again. And I certainly would recommend your services. I have attached a picture of Billy. His favorite things on Rhodes were the goat and wading in the Mediterranean. Have a wonderful Easter and may God bless you and your family. Very best wishes.<br>

    Nicholas developed an amazing day in Rhodes! Of all the Greek Islands, he made this our favorite. From Rhodes Town to a Donkey Ride in Lindos, feeding peacocks to a local lunch at a traditional restaurant, making pottery to St Paul's Bay...this day could not have been better planned to make full use of every second. Our driver spoke fluent English and was extremely knowledgeable on every historic site aspect of the country side.<br>

    tour, including the Jewish heritage within Greek life, we learned a lot of cultural
    and social facts about Rhodes. At the end of the tour, he was very helpful in
    pointing out directions to the Jewish Museum/synagogue and the directions back
    to the ship. Thank you so much, and please give our best wishes to Dominic and

    I was fascinated with the seven wonders of the ancient world and particularly
    the gigantic Colossus that stood over the harbor in Rhodes centuries ago. I had
    long been a wish of mine to visit Rhodes and see firsthand the wonders of this
    island. I would like you to know that the driving tour of Rhodes fully met my
    expectations and those of my companions as well. Michael was a friendly and knowledgeable
    tour driver. The historical buildings and old harbor were most interesting. The
    spectacular views of the two seas meeting and panoramic view of the Acropolis,
    the village and the port of Lindos provided us with a sensational photo opportunities.<br>\nIt
    was good meeting you personally at the meeting point, and thanks for making our

    Nicholas! Thank you so very much for the tour! It was a fantastic tour and my
    girlfriend and I had a fantastic time. Michael was full of information about the
    island and I had a great time talking to him and asking questions. It was nice
    to be able to understand the more traditional culture of those on the island rather
    than what all the tourists always see. And please let Michael know that his suggestion
    of the restaurant down the road from Sky in Kremasti was spot on and absolutely
    wonderful. By far the best meal I had in Rhodes.<br>\nAgain, thank you so much
    for the tour. It was well worth it and I would recommend it to anyone going to

    He explained so much, which we would not otherwise have known, we got to see so
    much beauty and such interesting places and it was so thoughtful to manage to
    drive us into the old city -- you are right I would not have managed to walk there.
    Never have we known such a thoughtful and helpful private tour, we will certainly
    recommend your service. Lunch was amazing too! We wish you both and your families

    photograph which you might like to pass on to Dominic, with our compliments. I
    didn't expect him to arrive in such a splendid limo- was this his personal taxi,
    or was this one of your fleet! Just a joke - his service was impeccable and we
    thoroughly enjoyed our excursion. I thought Rhodes looked prosperous and beautiful
    - there have been many changes since our last visit. I think we we were last on
    holiday on the island at least 20 years ago. Nextime we will try to spend more
    time and arrange for Dominic to drive us around again - particularly if he still
    has the same transport.<br>\nBest regards - Brian (Sept 30th)<br>\nbrian.mulligan16@yahoo.com\n\nHi

    you and the other driver Stathis very much. We appreciated the extra time you
    spent with us at the Restaurant in Haraki, and the opportunity for the girls to
    swim at the beach. Your choice of the restaurant was fantastic! We all had a great
    view, wonderful food, and the best calamari ever!<br>\nWe also appreciated the
    stop at the ceramics factory / showroom - it was very interesting and provided
    an opportunity for the girls to shop for unique souvenirs.<br>\nAgain, thank you
    for providing us with such a wonderful tour / drive of Rhodes - it was very scenic
    and the memory of Rhodes will stay with us forever!<br>\nVery best regards,<br>\nJoe

    We had such an amazing vacation and of all the beautiful places we visited in
    Greece, Rhodes was our favorite. We had such a wonderful day and tour, my only
    complaint is we did not get to spend enough time in Rhodes!<br>\nThank you again
    for your hospitality.<br>\nKristen Gannon (July 17th)<br>\nkwgannon@gmail.com\n\nHi-
    We are back home now and wanted to follow up regarding our wonderful driver while

    Manuel! Thank you for the follow up e-mail and your good wishes. We enjoyed touring
    Rhodes even though it was just a day. We had a nice lunch after the tour and had
    some time to do a little shopping. We are just getting back to our normal schedule
    at home. It seems like a dream seeing the different beautiful places in Greece.
    We will recommend your services to other travelers to Rhodes and on trip advisor.<br>\nBest

    Wanted to e-mail and let you know that our tour on June 25 with Michael was wonderful.
    He was so personable, answered lots of our questions, was extremely knowledgeable
    and made us feel completely at home. We saw so many more parts of Rhodes that
    we hadn't seen on our previous visit.<br>\nOur drive to and from Lindos was great....different
    road on the way back so we could see all the beautiful hotels. We also enjoyed
    Lindos and the special stop where the tour buses couldn't go...also the pick up
    and drop off place in Lindos was great as we avoided the long walk.<br>\nYour
    services will be recommended to any of my friends who might be going to Rhodes.<br>\nThank
    you again. (July 3rd)<br>\nStephanie & Johnny Iglehart<br>\nmrssbi@aol.com\n\nThank

    Nicholas, It was the BEST day ever!! If you ask any of my participants they would
    say Rhodes was their favorite island because it was all day and so relaxing. Getting
    off the ship and seeing your 5 Mercedes all lined up for us was WONDERFUL!! We
    adored the sight seeing, the Acropolis of Lindos, the donkey rides, but MOST OF
    ALL the seafood lunch at ARGOS. Fun swimming in the Mediterranean too.<br>\nThank
    you for setting up such a fine itinerary.<br>\nWith my very best regards, Pamela<br>\nPamela

    Hello to both of you! Nicholas and Christ. We had a fantastic time on your lovely island of Rhodes and really liked the drive out to Lindos.<br>
    The best part was the lunch at the seaside restaurant and the excellent company and companionship of Christ!<br>
    He had many stories to tell and really made us feel like he was a friend. If any of you do come to Singapore let us know and we will try to give you a 4hour tour of the island of Singapore plus a chilli crab lunch!!! I will be reviewing on tripadvisor soon! Keep up the great work guys!<br>

    Thank you again for a wonderful day. Yes, it was very informative and interesting. And thank you for always helping me out. Using a cane in Rhodes is not always easy. As you know, it was very important for my husband to see where his mother lived. We both got some wonderful pictures. My husband would like to go back again with our two sons. We will definitely call you when he does that.<br>

    Hi, Nick, Tom and Laura, and Pam and I arrived home safely and on time yesterday after a most enjoyable stay in Greece and Turkey.<br>
    Simply saying "Thank You" for guiding our tour of Rhodes seems insufficient. You proudly showed us the beautiful island where you live and work. We enjoyed meeting you and having you as our driver. We will definitely recommend you to anyone we know who will be traveling in Greece. We wish you a happy winter season and hope that your business continues to succeed in 2014.<br>

    Nicholas, We have only just arrived home after a wonderful and very memorable trip throughout Italy, and the many ship excursions to Turkey, Sicily and some of the many islands of Greece....Rhodes being most memorable. Dominic (Kiriakos)) was such an excellent tour/driver whom we all enjoyed immensely.<br>
    It was very nice to meet you...brief as it was. Thank you for asking Dominic to stop by. We will not hesitate to recommend "Rhodes Private Tours" to any of our family and friends that may travel to Rhodes in the future. Warmest regards. Please pass on our regards to Dominic<br>
    Jackie and Larry Cade jcade@shaw.ca (Dec 3rd)

    Many thanks Nick, we did enjoy our day with you and feel that we saw more of the island than we would have done off the ship.<br>
    However, the stop for lunch at Elena's was a definite highlight and we were really pleased you took us there.<br>
    We would definitely recommend to our friends.<br>
    Kind regards<br>

    Dear Nicholas, We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and the highlight was definitely our tour of Rhodes with Sergio. I highly recommend your service to anyone who wants an in-depth and pleasurable tour of Rhodes at an extremely reasonable cost. Also, many thanks to Sergio for recommending a restaurant for lunch after our tour. It was excellent. Wishing you and your families all the best for the upcoming holiday season and for a healthy, happy, and prosperous New Year. Anne anne.beirne@gmail.com (Nov 30th)

    Hello Nicholas!! We enjoyed your tour vey much, so much so, that we spent too much time eating @ that fabulous restaurant (would you send name?) that we were unable to see more of your beautiful island.

    Dear Nicholas, (August 18th)<br>
    Thank you so much for the wonderful day with you discovering Rhodes.The best thing about having a local person is that you really get to talk and learn about your life and your views, not just someone pointing out sites. This is how real communication works between people of different countries...not the media! Take away all the preconceptions and we are all people wanting a good life for our familes and to enjoy this beautiful earth.<br>
    And what a treasure Argos was,a perfectly beautiful place for lunch away from all the "tourists" (like me).Delicious<br>

    Hey Sergio and Nick,<br>
    We got back late due to the tropical storm in the Gulf. It has been crazy! In short, until the weekend, I just want to say Sergio was the BEST and I cannot thank him and you enough. It was incredible! Sergio went beyond his guide duties. The only issue is we are broke and my son, Hunter, wants a camera now:-)! Thanks to Sergio he wants to pick up photography! I will send photos this weekend after I download them.<br>
    Thanks again! We loved Rhodes! (June 28th)<br>

    Dear Nicholas<br>
    Thank you for organising the most wonderful tour for my family.<br>
    Our drivers Gianis and Stathis were excellent. Gianis was very fluent in English and his knowledge of the island meant that we found Rhodos to be our favourite Greek island. Stathis was always helpful and polite and he to was very good company. Cars were very comfortable and we would certainly recommend you to our friends.<br>
    I wish you luck with the current austerity problems which you are suffering in Greece and hope it all works out well for you.<br>

    We had a very nice time in Rhodes. Manuel was an excellent driver - we thoroughly

    Thank you so much for the service you provided for my husband and myself while
    we were in your beautiful country. The short time we spent there we learned so
    much of your history due to your expertise. I will definitely recommend your services
    to anyone traveling to Rhodes.<br>\nThank you, Terri Milligan<br>\ntmilligan666@hotmail.com\n\nNick,
    We just wanted to pass along a big thanks to you for the wonderful day you provided
    when Lisa, Ken, Marion and I were on Rhodes. We all treasure the sights you selected
    for the trip and the service you provided. I did pass along your hello to your
    Egyptian associate Rasha when we saw her a few days later in Cairo.<br>\nWe wish
    you lots of luck and success in your business.<br>\nDenny Beroiz<br>\nbajadenny@yahoo.com\n\nNicholas:
    Thank you. We all had a wonderful time on your tour & I will definitely recommend

    and would like to thank you for your excellent attention during our trip to Rhodes.<br>\nWe
    will try to put a note on the internet to that effect.<br>\nRegards Lis Macfarlane<br>\nlis.macfarlane@gmail.com\n\nHi
    Michael, We would like to send a special thank you to you and your brother Nicholas.
    We have had a great day out with you today. We saw so much with you that we probably
    would not have seen if we didn't do this tour with you. Mihalis my husband was
    born in Greece and has commented on how much knowledge you know of the island.
    We would recommend this tour to all our family back home in Australia. Thank you
    for taking us to where we wanted to go. Don't think any other tour would have
    done this much for us. Again thank you for a very very nice and relaxed day.<br>\nYasou
    from Antonetta, Mihalis, Nicholas and Marcus. (Sept 4th)<br>\nmantonakiou@hotmail.com\n\nBonjour,
    nous sommes bien rentrés chez nous.<br>\nNous avons apprécié notre sejour dans
    votre belle île et votre chauffeur a été parfait: il nous a bien expliqué tout
    ce que voyions et malgré les ambarras de circulation à cause des files dans les
    stations essence nous a bien conduit en temps et en heure partout où nous devions
    et voulions aller. Il a su nous faire apprécier de très beaux endroits.<br>\nNous
    recommanderons vos services à d'autres personnes sans problème.<br>\nPeut être
    à une prochaine fois<br>\nMartine FONTAINE<br>\nmartinedewert@hotmail.com\n\nHi
    Nick; To say we had an awesome time is a under statement. Thank you so much for
    all of your time and knowledge. We are talking about coming back to Rhodes again
    next year for a couple of days. Your island is beautiful and we want to explore
    it more. We also want to spend some time at St Paul's Bay. The restaurant that
    you took us to was wonderful, and swimming right there after we ate was a treat.
    You were wonderful. We look forward to seeing you again.<br>\nThank you once again<br>\nLisa
    & Steve Terrinoni<br>\nlst561@hotmail.com\n\nHello Nicholas,<br>\nThis is a late
    email from us to let you know who much we appreciate our tour of the Island of
    Rhodes. It's wonderful to look at our pictures and all the good memories.<br>\nBeth
    Smith for Paul, Mike and Wendy Hryniw<br>\npbsmith2@mts.net\n\nHello, We all enjoyed
    Rhodes, it will be among our favorites to visit if we are ever so lucky to return
    to the Greek Isles. Our driver Manuel was wonderful and we had lunch at a very
    nice place, it was all perfect. Booking anything through the internet is always
    a risk but in this case we were fortunate indeed to use your taxi service. I was
    so impressed with all the olive tree's and there beautiful silvery leaves and
    how our driver has had his tree's in his family for years, that I hope to grow
    my own olive tree. Not a grove of them but at least try to have one on my patio
    in Florida.<br>\nThank you once again,<br>\nSonya Bridges<br>\nbridgessonya@hotmail.com\n\nHello
    to you and please say hello to Michael too !<br>\nWe had a wonderful tour with
    Michael and will recommend you to our travel agent and friends. Rhodos is a beautiful
    island and we hope to return one day. Our best and thanks for a great time in
    Rhodos.<br>\nThanks, Bobette and Byron Siegel<br>\nBSSMSW@aol.com\n\nHello Nicholas<br>\nWe
    have just got back to New Zealand yesterday and had a wonderful trip. One of the
    highlight was of course our day in Rhodes with you - and thank you for taking
    us to Lindos and the restaurant - that too was a great choice.<br>\nMy brother
    and his wife will be going on an identical cruise in September and I have passed
    your information on to them. We shall certainly hope to return to Rhodes again
    and use your services again.<br>\nAll the best<br>\nKind regards,<br>\nRobyn &
    Alec Watling<br>\nwatling@clear.net.nz\n\nBack home now, I would like to congratulate
    you for the wonderful service. My friends and I had a great time in Rhodes toured
    by Michael! (June 9th)<br>\nSincerely, Luciana Cardoso<br>\nlcardoso70@yahoo.com.br\n\nHi
    Nicholas, What a great trip and one of the highlights was definitely our tour
    of Rhodes. You brought your beautiful island to life for us and our tour was truly
    a five star experience. Your thoughtfulness and knowledge and sense of fun and
    adventure gave us a memory we will not soon forget. We would urge anyone coming
    to Rhodes to make their first call to you to book a tour.<br>\nThank you again
    Nicholas.<br>\nPeggy Klos<br>\nToronto, Canada<br>\npeggyklos@sympatico.ca\n\nWe
    are safely home and our pictures remind us of the beautiful journey in your country.
    We will certainly make use of your services again, as well as inform our friends
    of the excellence of your services.<br>\nBest regards, Mike<br>\nmikevitiello@hotmail.com\n\nThanks,
    Nicholas. We very much enjoyed our trip to Rhodes and you were a large part of
    it. In fact, it was one of our favorite stops on the cruise. The rest of the trip
    went very well. My boss and her sister are going to Greece in November/December.
    I am not sure if she is going to Rhodes but if so, she will know who to call!<br>\nTake
    care.<br>\nTammy<br>\ntstringer@carolina.rr.com\n\nThank you Nick. Everything
    was wonderful and Rhodes was one of our better days. The driver was most kind
    and even helped my grandson find a special kind of rechargeable battery for his
    camera.<br>\nNancy Hamlin<br>\nn2hhamlin@frontiernet.net\n\nMy group of 3 persons
    spent a day & a half in Rhodes June 7 & 8, 2010. Nicholas, provided us with our
    transfer from the airport to the hotel. He was very polite & personable. He delivered
    us as close as he could to our hotel in Old Town & helped us carry our bags. He
    was wonderful! The next day we went on the full day tour of Rhodes. Nicholas was
    very knowledgeable and patient, never rushing us as we were sightseeing. He also
    took us to a nice restaurant for lunch!! He was the best tour driver I have ever
    dealt with!!! I highly recommmend touring with Nicholas. We had only one full
    day in Rhodes and he made sure we saw the best of it!!! After the tour he dropped
    us off at the port. Nicholas, Thank you for such a wonderful experience in Rhodes!<br>\nKeep
    up the good work!<br>\nKia Edwards, Georgia USA<br>\nrnangel38@yahoo.com\n\nHi
    Nicholas. Just a brief note to thank you, and specially Michael, for the excellent
    service we had in our tour, with his knowledge. We really enjoy it, and will recommend
    you. Not everybody is willing to take an individual tour, and prefer the cruise
    tours, but for those willing to do it, this one really works.<br>\nRegards<br>\nPedro
    Perez<br>\npperezn88@yahoo.com\n\nHi Nicholas, We both enjoyed our trip to Rhodes.
    We would love to return for a longer stay although at this stage I don't know
    when that may be. We both have been telling our friends that the private excursion
    is the way to go. It is more relaxing and can be modified if there is something
    one wants to do or doesn't want to do.<br>\nAll the best,<br>\nJon Johnson<br>\nCalgary,
    Canada<br>\njcjperfins@hotmail.com\n\nNicholas, We are home safe and thoroughly
    enjoyed our time with George while in Rhodes. The restaurant was wonderful and
    we had such a good time! We will certainly pass your name on to relatives and
    friends should anyone wish to visit beautiful Greece.<br>\nMy best,<br>\nLewis

    Nick: Michael and I just wanted to thank you for an amazing tour of Rhodes. We
    decided it was our favorite spot in Greece and your tour to both sides of the
    Island, the wine region and historic sights made our visit very special. We especially
    enjoyed our wine tasting at the small, family wineries and at the general wine
    tasting facility in the wine area. It provided such a great opportunity to taste
    a variety of interesting and good local wines. As we mentioned, we have friends
    coming to the area in middle June and we will definitely recommend your services.
    I'm not sure what their plans are but we will certainly encourage them to use
    your firm. The professionalism of your firm was greatly appreciated, especially
    your prompt and complete replies to our emails as we began planning our trip.<br>\nAgain,
    our thanks.<br>\nWarm regards,<br>\nBobbie and Michael<br>\nmetzgerb@earthlink.net "

    Dear Nicholas, The four of are still talking about our Rhodes tour as the "Highlight" of our trip! We had a wonderful time, and have threatened to come back and buy an olive grove and live there. We truly loved your island. Our driver (cannot remember his name-what was it, please?) was charming and informative and friendly. We will certainly call you again should we get back to Rhodes and recommend your tour to any of our friends traveling to Rhodes.<br>
    Happy New Year!<br>

    Nicholas. You have a good eye when taking photos. You took one of our family with the harbor scene in the background. It was so good that I had copies made and included them in many of my Christmas cards. Our visit to Rhodes is fondly remembered and you helped make the experience special. Thank you. If I know of anyone coming to Rhodes, you may be assured that I will heartily recommend your service. And a very special holiday season is wished for you and your family.<br>

    Thank you very much for the tour today. We really enjoyed the sights of Rhodes and all the things you told us about the island. It was very interesting. You had a joke with us about the ship not being there when we got back and guess what - yes, 2 passengers missed the ship and have to find their own way to Limassol, Cyprus. Glad you made sure that it WASN'T us!!!!!! (Sept 10th)<br>

    Chelsea and I just wanted to say thanks, we had a wonderful time in Rhodes! We enjoyed our tour of the island with you, and thank you for taking us to that great little restaurant. Aspen loves his pendant I bought him. Chelsea and I did go back to the Old Town and also did a lot walking around the New Town, we just had a wonderful time. I hope some day too return to Rhodes. Rhodes is a beautiful place full of beautiful people! Miss it already. (March 10th 2009)<br>

    We enjoyed the time we spent with you and have been telling friends and family what a terrific service you provided to us. It will be our pleasure to recommend you. (Feb. 21st 2009)<br>

    Dear Nicholas,<br>
    Thank you so much for your help and services. The driver in Athens was fantastic. He is someone that you can proudly send anyone with. His van was the best I have seen in Europe. The guide in Malta was not bad but she was just fair.<br>
    Our gyro that we had with you is still the best we have ever eaten! I will be contacting you whenever I have clients to send. Thank you again for everything!<br>

    Hi Nicholas,<br>
    We made it home with no problems. After we left you we had a nice day in Cyprus. Cairo was wild! It was a long day to the pyramids from Alexandria. We had a minibus with 2 others and our guide and driver. Alexandria looks very interesting also. It was very quiet at 715 am when we left but at 730 in the evening it was very much alive.<br>
    Malta was a nice day also. We only were there 2-630PM . I wish we had more time there. Then It was back to Barcelona where we stayed the night and flew home.<br>
    Thanks again for everything. We had a nice day with you. The food where you dropped us off was excellent also. We spent a bit of time walking around Old Town before we got back on the ship. We will try to see Guns of Navarone again sometime soon. I was very young when I saw it. If you ever get to Florida(Orlando/Daytona) let us know.<br>
    Thanks again, Dave/Cheryl Johnson (January 31st)<br>

    Nicholas, Fabulous tour. Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much we enjoyed the day. Your sense of humor, knowledge of the area and fabulous suggestions made for the perfect day. We're nearing the end of our trip and in Venice. We will definitely be back next year. If you need a recommendation, please let me know.

    Nicholas, thank you so very much for an outstanding tour of Rhodes. My friends and I were impressed with your knowledge of the the island and our trip was more memorable because of you. I especially enjoyed the phyllo pastry with honey at the Restaurant; the flavor was exceptional. You were so kind to take us there for lunch. Good luck to you and thanks again for a terrific tour!

    Hi Nicholas, We wanted to thank you again for taking us on a tour of Rhodes. Rhodes was one of our favorite places, and we saw much more of the island on your tour than we would have with a shore excursion from the cruise line. I appreciated the fact that we were able to stop for pictures in several spots, and we never felt rushed while we explored sites on our own. If I have friends going to Rhodes, I'll be sure to recommend you for a tour! (Nov 20th) Thanks, Rebecca and William<br>

    Thank you Nick. I'm still remembering that delicious lunch at Helena's (?). I've been making baked feta often and I'm looking forward to trying your recipe for the grilled feta-sounds fantastic. Thank you again, hopefully we'll meet again. (Nov 19th) Warmly, Paula<br>

    Hi Nicholas, We had a wonderful cruise, very relaxing and lots of great sights! Everyone really enjoyed your tour, especially my father.

Best wishes, (Oct 1) Beth<br>

    Hello Nicholas,. Your excursion was great and we all enjoyed it very much...it was certainly one of the highlights of our trip. We are still talking about having lunch at that Restaurant and the great food and service both from you and the people at the restaurant. It will be a day we all long remember.

    Dear Nicholas:<br>
    Our family cannot thank you enough for making our trip to Rhodes absolutely UNFORGETTABLE. Having you for our driver was the only way to tour Rhodes and I am so glad that we did not sign up for a shore excursion. We appreciated your amazing personal and very professional service, the beautiful places you showed us in Rhodes and the great care you took to make sure it was a memorable experience for us. We saw three times as many things as we would have seen on a shore excursion thanks to you so we got a much better value for our money. We also appreciated your amazing attention to details such as when you gave us the luxury of being dropped off at the top of many sites to walk our way to the bottom where you were always waiting with a smile and air-conditioned car. We watched as the tour bus people hiked up long stretches of road to get back to their busses spending most of their time navigating the logistics of being on a tour bus instead of enjoying all that Rhodes has to offer. We definitely plan to see you again and will be recommending you to all of our friends and family! Again, many thanks for an amazing visit in Rhodes !! It would not have been the same without you!!<br>

    Rhodes was beautiful and our drivers were wonderful. We were amazed by the contrasting landscape and neighborhoods of Rhodes. Your island is certainly a place we would like to visit again. As you may be aware, there was some confusion regarding the fee. As it turned out we had paid to much and we were pleasantly surprised to be informed by the ship's Purser that the over payment had been returned. It is important for future travelers to know that the companies recommended by members of Cruise Critic are honest and forth right. We will certainly recommend your services to our cruise critic friends. In fact, my grandmother is planning a tour of the greek islands for next fall. I have already told her about your company.<br>

    Hi Michael and Nicholas. Thanks so much for making the trip to Rhodes as good as it could possibly have been. We enjoyed your driving us around the island, stopping at the sites we wanted to visit and showing us things we never would have known about otherwise. We loved the donkey ride at Lindos and the lunch prepared by the sisters, the Three Musketeers, at the church at the top of the Valley of the Butterflies was wonderful. It was also very nice to walk downhill in that lovely valley instead of hiking the distance uphill. We did notice that any temple, fortress, walled city or other important site in Greece is located on the top of the highest, steepest mountain around, so it was nice for once to only have to walk down.<br>
    Thank you again and I hope to get back to Rhodes some day. I'll surely call you if I do!<br>

    With only a limited time to spend on the island, George the "American" made sure that we saw all the highlights of Rhodes before our cruise left port. His cheerful, lively personality was a real treat. He was knowledgeable and informative - there wasn't a question he couldn't answer. One of the day's highlights was a delicious and quite inexpensive Greek lunch at a family owned restaurant. He promised the best chicken - kebab we ever tasted and he delivered. After returning to the ship, we compared stories with friends on cruise tours of Rhodes and found, to no surprise, that our experience was far superior, much more personal and certainly less expensive. Thank you for the lovely day and all the best to you and to George from our family, now back in Miami. Rest assured that we will be highly recommending your service to any and all that may visit your lovely island.<br>

I have some great photos of the trip, and have been trying to get them in an album, along with my daily journal. It was a wonderful trip all together, and we especially liked Rhodes. I have given your contact information to several other travel agents. I will send business to you whenever I have the opportunity. Private touring is the ONLY way to go!<br>

    Dear Nicholas. I have been trying to catch up at work, but wanted to send you an email to let you know what a wonderful day Jerrie and I had with you. We tell everyone how informative you were and at the same time we had so much fun and felt like we had made a friend. Jerrie goes around telling everyone that it was so bright in Rhodes that she didn't know where her sunglasses were until I told her that they were on her face. I got some wonderful photographs in the Valley of the Butterflies showing large clusters of them on the trees and actually catching a few in flight.<br>
    I wrote Matt Barrett a thank you letter letting him know how wonderful you and Dimitris were. One of my favorite stories I have told people was about sitting at lunch on the black beach on Santorini and Dimitris handing me the phone and telling me to say hello to you. He said that he got a booking from our laughing and having a good time on the phone.<br>
    When my friends have asked me what was my favorite part of the trip, I tell everyone without any hesitation, it was the wonderful Greek people that we met. Everyone, was so warm and welcoming that we felt at home from the moment we landed on Rhodes until our departure to home from Rhodes on July 9th.<br>
    Thank you again for everything.<br>

    Hi Nicholas. First, please accept my apology for not thanking you earlier for the surprise wine gift. I have been intending to do so, but was negligent. I have not tried the wine yet, but am looking forward to doing so. I am visting a friend in Houston next month and plan on sharing with her. Alas, the tasty baklava did not survive long enough to share the same fate.<br>
    I did very much enjoy the tour. I had never been to Rhodes before, but do hope to return. Give Michael (is that the proper spelling) my regards and thanks! I have more to say, but all good. Another day, but hopefully soon.<br>

    Hello, It's me -- Patsy -- Sarah Welch's sister. We were glad to get home, as it was a long, tiring trip from Rome to Zurich, then on to Dallas. Was good to sleep in my own bed that night!<br>
    I want to express my thanks to you for being such a wonderful host while we were in Rhodes. What a fun time we had with you! You made us laugh with your funny comments. Rhodes is indeed a beautiful place. Too bad we were there for such a short time. We would love to come back some day when we can stay longer and see more. Our travel days are not over, so who knows when we might be back to see you.<br>
    I'm sending 3 photos so you won't forget us. We certainly will not forget you and our fun-filled day with you. I know Sarah will be recommending you to her clients who may be coming to Rhodes.<br>
    God bless you and your family.<br>

    Dear Nick,<br>
    Although we've been back in New York for over a month, (we got back on Jan.14th 07) our trip to Greece and our time spent in Rhodes are still very fresh in our minds and conversations. In America, we have an expression that says if your ears are ringing it means someone must be talking about you. Well, if there's any truth to that statement, your ears must be chiming continuously. You were a fabulous driver while we were in Rhodes and I've not only told people about how much you enhanced our visit with your knowledge of Rhodes, but also how you demonstrated superhuman patience while my older daughter was shopping. A colleague of mine has friends who are planning a trip to Greece later this year and I've already told him about both you in Rhodes and Dennis in Athens. I think they'd be crazy not to call you!!! Thank you for sharing your knowledge of Rhodes and making our trip such a memorable one.<br>

  text: "Honest. Reliable. Knowledgeable. Trustworthy. These are just a few of the
    words I can use to express my feelings towards Nick and his very professional
    team. We arrived to Rhodes during an extremely busy period with over 7,000 people
    traveling to the island. Despite this chaos, Nick and his team showed us and our
    guests a fantastic and highly enjoyable time. We toured the island, leisurely
    and Nick never missed a photo opportunity or chance to share an extra special
    tid-bit of information regarding the island. He made sure we maximized our time
    in all of the \"right\" places and his recommendations for restaurants were BEYOND
    perfect. I commend Nick for a job well done and thank him personally for going
    above and beyond any expectation that I had of a \"city tour\". Thanks again,

    day we spent with you in Rhodes. Lindos was fantastic, both the acropolis, and
    then eating on the water.  We really like the patterns of the ceramics we purchased,
    and want more of the same. Also, we enjoyed our day with you so much that if you
    need a reference for the future, I'd be happy to provide that for you.<br>\nSincerely,

    Nicholas!  My husband, my mother and I truly enjoyed ALL of our time touring with
    Dominic on the lovely island of Rodos. He gave us such an interesting and friendly
    tour. My husband who is from an agricultural area of Central California (growing
    peaches, grapes, almonds) was very interested in the olive trees and the grape
    vineyards and Dominic told us...and showed us all about it! Hank was thrilled
    to hug a 800-year old olive tree! Please say hello and thanks to Dominic from
    us.<br>\nOf all our Greek tours on the various Islands and in Athens area, yours
    was the VERY BEST because of your friendliness, attention to details, and your
    quick response to questions on the internet. Our only regret is that we had such
    a short time to spend on what is now our FAVORITE island. We must return soon.
    Thanks to you and your whole group for making this a very special day for us.
    Continued success!<br>\nYours truly,<br>\nCharlotte, Hank and Dottie, California

    imagine. We will come back again some day and next time bring our children along.<br>\nWe

    had a wonderful time on our tour with Michael. He is a very nice, well informed
    and accomodating driver. His concern for my sore ankle was much appreciated, as
    he drove me to where I could see the acropolis in Lindos while the others walked
    to the top. While we were there, we enjoyed good conversation and a cup of coffee.

    enjoyed our tour of Rhodes which you provided so professionally. On returning
    from the cruise, Shirley and I left immediately for three weeks in Tennessee (700
    miles south). We just returned.<br>\nWe particularly enjoyed your cheerful agreement
    to our changes of itinerary. It was so nice to be able to see all the sights from
    the comfort of your car. We thoroughly appreciated riding down those narrow streets
    instead of stumbling over the cobblestones. We also enjoyed the opportunities
    to get out and make pictures whenever we wished.<br>\nWhat a treat to stop at
    the road side cafe on the way back from Lindos, taste some native foods, learn
    the proper names and get the recipe!<br>\nIt was so kind of you to take Ron, who
    couldn't walk, back to the ship and then take us back to Old Town along with giving
    directions to get back to the ship. In short, the tour you gave us could not have
    been better.<br>\nThank you again,<br>\nJim and Shirley  FL USA\n\nNicholas,  thank
    you for sending us your web-site address. I have already bookmarked it and will

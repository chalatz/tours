Create Your Own Custom Tour

We recognize that every tourist isn’t the same. Some may be here to see the beautiful landscapes while others may want to tour the lovely seaside villages. Others may come here to enjoy the spiritually rich history of the place. That’s why we have the option to create a custom tour. You can choose to do whatever you like without clashing with other tour groups or getting sidetracked. Enjoy what you want to.

Rhodes Tours Are Relaxing

Rest breaks are crucial during tours, especially those that weave through different terrain. Our tours are designed to be relaxing. Whether you’re a couple or a group of friends that are traveling together, we cater to your comfort and your enjoyment.

Small Groups Big Experiences

We know you’re here to have an experience that you’ll never forget. You don’t want to get swept away with the crowd without seeing any of the sights. That’s why we keep our groups small. That way everyone has a chance to take in the sights and sounds, ask questions, experience the area and then move on.  Small group activities also allow for much more individual involvement. They strike a balance between spontaneity and planned activities. That way, you’ll get time to do what you want, and also follow the group to a great destination.

Experience the Island of Rhodes Through Its Inhabitants

You haven’t really experienced Rhodes until you’ve seen it through the eyes of tis local population. Our tours offer the chance to connect with the native culture as well as its landmarks. It’s not really a tour until you realize the significance of the landmarks through the eyes of its people. See how the locals shop, where they gather, where they live, how they go about their daily lives. Experience an entire world that you’ve never seen with your eyes before.

Choose Your Own Tour

Once you’ve decided how you want to proceed, you can choose your own experience. Choose the destinations, the type of landmarks you want to see, and the type of tour you want to go on. It’s our job to make it a reality. We will make sure all your requirements and needs are taken care of to give you the holiday experience of your life.

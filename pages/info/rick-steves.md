Rick Steves is an American travel writer, author and television personality. He has created and hosted travel shows on America's Public Broadcasting Service since 1991. He also has expanded into radio, newspaper and the Internet. Rick encourages travelers to become what he calls **"temporary locals,"** not just visiting big cities but venturing out to experience small towns and villages away from popular tourist sites.

Since his first book came out in 1980, Steves has written tour-books for countries, cities and regions. He has started a new genre of travel writing recounting his favourite moments in collections of anecdotes from his many years of travel.

### Rick Steves in Rhodes Island

Rick visited Rhodes in order to learn about the culture and history of our beautiful island. I spent a day with him and his crew while they planned, wrote and filmed for his television program **Rick Steves' Europe**. I found Rick to be as pleasant as he appears on his shows. He was a thoroughly nice and professional gentleman and clearly loves what he does. I am grateful that he chose our business to introduce him to Rhodes and to assist him and his crew in getting around the island.

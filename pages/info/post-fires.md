Recently, our customers, having seen the news and social media coverage of the fires on Rhodes, have been asking us whether there is something left to visit or if Rhodes has been reduced to miles and miles of burned landscape. They were concerned about the Island and about us. Let us help put the situation into perspective for you.

* At approximately 50 mi (80 km) long and 24 mi (38 km) wide, the Island of Rhodes is probably bigger than you think. The wildfires that burned for 12 days, destroyed only 15% of the landscape, not the whole island. The fire started on southwest and spread southeast to an area called Kiotari. (11 miles / 18 km south of Lindos)

* The primary damage was to small villages in the center of the island and not any of the areas we go to on our tours. Rhodes is still beautiful, with many interesting areas to visit.

* Fortunately, Lindos was spared as the surrounding area is rocky, so there was no fuel for the fires.

* If you travel up the east coast of the island with us from the Cruise Port to Lindos (35 mi / 48 km), you will not see one burned tree, simply because the wildfire was in another part of the island and didn't touch the sites we visit.

* Please read our client's reviews of July and August. There are no reviews about burned landscapes. Just notes about the wonderful tours to historic sites.

We hope that we have answered all your questions. If you have been undecided whether to come to Rhodes, we hope we have helped you make up your mind. Now you can see that our tours have not been impacted and that you can still have a lovely visit to our beautiful island.

Kind Regards

  content: "Nicholas A. Rhodes was born in Alexandria, Egypt. His parents were Greek,
    from the big \"Hellenic Community of Alexandria\". (Greek Community of Alexandria)
    \n\nAfter finishing high school he continued with his education as a programming
    and system designer. At the same time his brother Michael was finishing the Tourism
    College in Cairo. After graduating they both moved to Athens for a few years and
    eventually settled on the beautiful island of Rhodes where they became involved
    with the ever growing tourism trade. Nick found enough time to marry and produce
    two adorable children - one son and one daughter. Nick and Michael now run a professional
    and successful private tours business.\n\nNick and Michael are fluent in Greek
    (obviously!), English and Arabic are perfect (spoken and written), Spanish, German
    and Italian are comprehensible, also some French - enough for basic conversation."

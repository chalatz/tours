#### PRIVATE TOURS, SHORE EXCURSIONS, TRANSFERS

We have been providing shore excursions and private tours to cruise passengers and those visiting Rhodes by plane for over 35 years. The vehicles of our associate tour/drivers and minibus/drivers are regularly maintained for optimal safety and performances. By booking any tour/service via this website you accept that vehicles are mechanical objects subject to various unpredictable malfunctions that can happen unexpectedly during your service.  At no time will you hold RhodesPrivateTours.com responsible or liable for any vehicle malfunctions mechanical or otherwise or issue public complaints for matters beyond our control. In the case of an accident caused physical and mental damage, the liability lies exclusively with the participating vehicles.

While we make every effort to return you to your ship / aeroplane on time, there can, in extreme circumstances, be incidents completely out of our control which might delay your arrival back at the port / airport. For this reason, we recommend passengers return to the port / airport at the recommended time indicated by your tour driver or your tour guide. We also recommend to buy travel insurance to provide extra security in the unlikely event of a missed boarding. Your booking with us serves as an acknowledgment that you accept the Terms of Service and have made the necessary arrangements to minimize disappointments while traveling, and you absolve Rhodes PrivateTours.com of any liability due to circumstances beyond our control.

#### ADDITIONAL PASSENGERS

On shore excursions, we only accept passengers that have been booked in advance. Any last-minute additions to the number of passengers must be submitted at least 48 hours in advance so we can update your reservation voucher and revise the new price of the tour. In order to comply with Port Authority and security, we are required to present the reservation voucher when asked by security officials.  We can only transport the number of passengers declared in that voucher.

#### TOURING WITH CHILDREN

Tours offered are geared toward adult participants.  The content and commentary during private guided tours may include subjects such as History, Ancient Rhodes, Architecture, Culture, and other subjects that children may or may not find interesting. The tours provided are not geared toward interests of children. 

If you are interested in “kid friendly” activities, we can suggest other venues you can explore separately during your stay in Rhodes that are more suitable for children. The tours we offer are rich in historical and cultural content that is most understood and appreciated by adults who share such interests.

#### YOUR TOUR-DRIVER (CHAUFFEUR)

For the Driving Tours (Chauffeured Tours) you are provided a private tour with a Driver who is NOT a Licensed Tour Guide and will not provide services of a guide.

Greece has strict laws and regulations in place to protect licensed tour guides. This makes it unlawful for Tour Drivers to offer commentary about sites outside the vehicle. In order for us to comply with Hellenic laws, Tour Drivers may not accompany our guests inside monuments and museums.  Only licensed Tour Guides may guide you at the sites you visit.

For your safety inside the vehicle, drivers provide commentary only when it is deemed safe to do so while driving. When your driver must concentrate during various driving conditions, please refrain from any distracting behavior as your safety during the tour is our top priority. 

#### AMBIENCE INSIDE YOUR VEHICLE

If you have preferences regarding A/C, heat, or typically experience motion sickness while in a moving vehicle, please feel free to let your driver know immediately so he can accommodate your needs. If you do not make your needs known to your driver, he would not know how to make your tour more comfortable.  If you have difficulty hearing your driver speak, please ask him to speak louder. Only licensed tour guides are lawfully permitted to use microphones and audio systems inside the vehicle.

#### ANY PROBLEMS DURING YOUR TOUR?

If you are experiencing any issues or problems during the tour, please call us at the telephone number provided. If you do not have a working cell phone, please ask your Tour-Driver or your Tour Guide to call the office from his cell phone so we can help you and resolve any issues you may be experiencing.

If you experienced any issues during your tour and did not call the company during the tour to rectify the situation, you agree to inform the company by email of the issues you experienced and allow the company reasonable attempts to resolve your issues satisfactorily before publishing any complaints anywhere publicly, including social sites, peer review sites, blogs, and any other areas on the Internet. If the company settles your issues satisfactorily and the matter is resolved, you agree to refrain from publishing any negative comments, ratings, or reviews about Rhodes PrivateTours.com on the Internet or elsewhere. Failure to honor this agreement is considered a violation of contract and the terms upon which you agreed prior to booking your service and entering a legal contract with Rhodes PrivateTours.com

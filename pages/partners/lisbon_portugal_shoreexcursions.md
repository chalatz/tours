Personalized Guided Tours of Lisbon, Sintra, Mafra and Queluz plus Fátima and Tomar!

If crowded tour groups with "one itinerary fit all attitudes" are not for you, I have the answer. One of my full (7 hour) day or half (4 hour) day Lisbon and/or environs tours is just what you are looking for.

Hello, I am Mary Harrison Goudie your-Lisbon-guide, originally from Scotland but also with Portuguese nationality. I have a Fine Art degree, love antiques, sailing and walking. Rui, my Portuguese husband, is the driver on the tour. We pick you up from your Cruise Ship or Hotel in our 7-seater air-conditioned SUV, a Nissan Patrol GR. You are then going to have all of my 27-year experience of living in Lisbon to guide you and give you an insider's view of the city and its surroundings.

A full days tour is around 7 hours including a one hour lunch break (and you must feed the guide not the driver). We pick you up a little before 10.00am (or after 09:30), and expect to be back around 5.00pm (17.00). The half-day tour is mornings only, with the same start time getting back by 2.00pm (14.00). Remember we are flexible, so we could start at noon and finish at 4.00pm.

Although I do offer tours of Lisbon; Mafra (an extravagant baroque and neo-classical monument covering 10 hectares); Sintra (a world heritage site and one of Lord Byron's haunts); plus Queluz (a Rococo Versailles look-alike palace) - are also on my list of must see locations.

You chose the destination and the tour forms around your needs and preferences. Right now, we are exploring the possibilities of getting an accessible vehicle for doing tours with disabled or wheelchair bound persons. We have indeed found a minibus in Lisbon which can take three wheelchairs and up to 8 persons with a lift platform.

For instance if you are a "can't get enough of art and history" sort of person, a full days tour of Mafra and Sintra could have you overdosing on baroque splendor whilst listening to the largest collection of church bells in the world in carillon concert (that occasionally happen in Mafra). Next, open-mouthed at the 16th century Moorish mudéjar style ceilings and then on to the Disneyesque, over the top, 19th century Pena palace overflowing with all sorts of stuff including a table standing on Meissen porcelain legs.

Lastly, you can look out to sea from the most Westerly (Cabo da Roca) point of mainland Europe before heading back for the day.

Perhaps you are more of the outdoor country scenery type: then, another full day tour of Fátima and Tomar could have you getting ideas whether you are Jewish or Catholic. Not to mention Óbidos Castle-town, this is another day trip.\
South of the River Tagus (Tejo) via a Florida Keys-type long bridge (Vasco da Gama) you could visit one of Portugal's windmill ranges, we have more here than in the Netherlands and look at the Portuguese Riviera (Arrábida mountain/seaside resorts of Portinho de Arrábida or Sesimbra), where we can stop for lunch, before returning via the Cristo Rei (Christ The King - Statue, which just celebrated it's 50th Anniversary in 2009) and back into Lisbon across the 25 Abril Bridge (formerly known as the Ponte Salazar - 1966 Bridge.

These are just some of the pleasurable possibilities that are available when you opt for one of my personalized tours. The choice is yours.

Sincerely Mary Harrison Goudie\

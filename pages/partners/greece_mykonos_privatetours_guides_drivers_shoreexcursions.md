Discover the beauties of Mykonos with a private tour guide just for you and your family or friends. We operate private excursions in Mykonos with our mini vans and coaches. Tours are planned to your requirements (price, duration and interests) and are escorted by the best guides on the island. The tours can be booked also by clients arriving on cruise ships. We will meet you at the port with a sign with your name and begin our tour of Mykonos. We are open to your suggestions or preferences.

Quality of life was so extremely important to the inhabitants of Myconos that they traditionally discovered a way to engineer the edges of roof tops in order to eliminate the sound of the whistling wind ! See For Yourself: Take time out and fully experience Myconos, the island that has been given the name **"White Island"**. On this excursion you will have the pleasure of witnessing its breathtakingly beautiful beaches, unspoiled landscapes, picturesque churches, dove-cotes and windmills. This excursion will take you on a tour of the island where you will visit, appreciate and test out the beaches of Aghios Giannis, Ornos, Aghios Stefanos, Kalafatis and Aghia Anna. This excursion will also make its way to the Monastery of Panagia Tourliani, in the village of Ano Mera, where its precious and magnificently sculptured gold plated iconostasis made in Florence in 1767 and its unique coexistance of a Greek-Orthodox Byzantine bell-tower with a western tradition currently remains. Furthermore, this journey will escort you on a walking tour through Mykonos Town where you will learn... and may even catch a glimpse of "Pelican Petros" wandering in the streets. So bring your cameras and enjoy the island gifts that await you.

Where people and nature weave a harmonious synthesis of the present with threads of a distant, and glorious past. Lying as the island does, on the crossroads of the three ancient continents - Europe, Asia and Africa - it has inherited something from each. From Europe, its cosmopolitan air, from Asia its reserved, traditional character, from Africa its palm trees and the hot breath of the south wind.

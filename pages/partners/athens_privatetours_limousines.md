Greetings from sunny Athens Greece. I am Dennis Kokkotos, son of George Kokkotos, otherwise known as George The Famous Taxi Driver. After moving to Greece from the USA and completing my military service and then finishing my studies as a physical therapist I decided to follow my father into the business. But I wanted to be something more than a taxi driver, (not that my father is an ordinary taxi driver). I wanted to provide something a little more classy than your run of the mill E-Class Luxury Mercedes that my father and his fellow drivers use. I wanted to drive a big new black luxury Mercedes with high-rollers and beautiful movie stars in the back seat. Well I have the big new black luxury Mercedes and I have had a few high-rollers and some movie stars and even a few beautiful models as clients and I have come to the realization that this is the most interesting job in the world. I have learned more from my clients than I have in all my years of school and I hope that they have learned a lot about Athens from me.

What kind of services do I provide? First of all there are the businessmen who come to Greece and hire me to pick them up at the airport and take them around the city to various meetings, back to the hotel, to dinner and sometime to show them where the best nightlife is. Then there are the writers, television producers and correspondents who hire me to take them to the places of interest for whatever stories they are working on. Then there are the people who hire me for tours of Athens and the rest of Greece because their group is too big for a taxi. Then of course there are the clients who book a limo wherever they go.

So why hire me? Well, I am young but very knowledgeable about Athens and Greece, the archaeology as well as the nightlife, where to eat, where to stay, what to buy and how to get from point A to point B as quickly, safely and as comfortably as possible. I speak English almost as well as my clients, since after all I was born in the states. I dress neatly and my car is spotless. And I have learned a lot about how to provide excellent service from my Father who is famous for it. So next time you come to Greece and you need something a little bigger and classier than my Father's Mercedes contact me, Dennis Kokkotos, to pick you up at the airport and take you to your hotel, show you Greece or help you do your business in Athens by providing the transportation and being there to answer your questions and giving whatever assistance you need.

Sincerely Dennis Kokkotos

Hello, my name is Panagiotis Zaharopoulos and I was born at Krestena in 1980. I've been a taxi driver for five years in Pirgos and i am very dedicated to this job. Greece have very beautifull places to go. I have a big new car Mercedes Benz E CLASS with leather seats, airconditioned. It's a big car, enough for 4 adults or 5 (if there are children). I have taken tours for athens several times, olympia, Epicurios APOLLON etc. My father and my brother are taxi drivers too. I have a very good and worthiness family.

Useful Info about your tours. The distance from katakolon to ancient Olympia is 38km. it's about 30min driving so I think you need 2h or 2.5h to see all the archaeological monuments. If you want to visit EPICURIOS APOLLON together with ancient Olympia, I think that 5 hours are enough to make your tour comfortable. There are also a lot of beautiful beaches like skafidia, loutra kyllinis, kaifas etc. I think this information will help you make your trip safe and pleasant. Of cource I speak quite well English so there will be no problems. Thank you.

Katakolo is part of the municipality of Pyrgos (Ilia). The town centre is within a gulf overlooking the Ionian Sea. It has a small port which is the main port of pyrgos, a school, restaurants, a church and a town square. Small hills with forests surround Katakolo. Katakolo is situated on a peninsula and has a lighthouse founded southwest. The Lighthouse katakolon (Faros Katalkolo) was first opened in 1865. It is also a frequent stop for cruise ships on tours of the Ionian and Mediterranean seas. Consequently, many of the shops in the town centre are geared toward foreign tourists.

Sincerely<br>
Panagiotis Zaharopoulos<br>
Your taxi driver in Katakolon.

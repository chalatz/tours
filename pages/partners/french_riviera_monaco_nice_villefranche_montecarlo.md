Revelation Tours has been created during spring 2001. We started with the ambition to become the Reference in sightseeing tours on the French Riviera, we never had the ambition to be the biggest.

The quality of tours has always been our main preoccupation. In our business quality and quantity cannot work together. The more you have vehicles the more you will need to standardize and minimize your tours and your services, the more you will need to spend time in the office and hire employees to realize the tours.

With 2 or 3 vehicles (during the high season) Revelation is and will remain a small company, and if we increase something, it will be the number of services we offer to our clients. The French Riviera is unique. It's the place where the Alps plunge into the sea, where the villages have been founded by forgotten tribes more than 2000 years ago, where the cities have been built by the ancient Greeks, where most of the painters and writers of the 19th and 20th centuries came to find inspiration, where Italy meets Provence, where the most luxurious palaces mix with fortified cities, where you can seat on the beach to see the eternal snow on the top of the Alps, where the ruins are roman and the chapels gothic, where medieval monuments face high tech buildings, where history dates back over 900 000 years ago. But like for every unique place, you could miss all of it or you can enjoy an unforgettable experience. Discovering the French Riviera with us, it's not simply visiting a place, it's sharing our passion for this region.

Regardless how high your expectations can be, REVELATION TOURS is your door step to enjoy every aspects of the French Riviera.

See you soon on the Riviera !

Michel Legrand Director

- Amy Pace - Guided Tours of Malta and Gozo
---

My name is Amy Pace, and I am a native of Malta, where I grew up, attending the local University. Tour guiding combines my love for history, architecture and archaeology with teaching, all of which relate to my background.

I am an **accredited licensed tour guide**, and have been since 1985, therefore having twenty five years of experience in the tour leading industry. I am also a **licensed tour organizer**, providing private customized tours for individuals and for groups, for all the sites on Malta and Gozo. I am the sole contact from the moment of the initial inquiry, suggesting suitable agendas and costs, through to performing the actual tour.

I am responsible for seeing that itineraries are observed, for ensuring the safety of my guests, as well as for getting them back in time for events.

I offer a variety of tours, at reasonable charges, both historical and archeological, including walking tours of Valletta and of the walled old Capital Mdina, as well as sites not normally sought by tourists, such sites, as would show the true character of the island and its people.

I only engage transport of good standards, and chauffeur driven, so that no time is lost in looking for parking, and the available time is maximized. The guests are picked-up and dropped off at their point of origin or by arrangement. I am always ready to forward my cell phone number so it is possible to communicate any last minute changes.

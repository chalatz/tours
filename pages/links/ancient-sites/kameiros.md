title: Ancient Kamiros - Rhodes Greece
summary: The town of Kamiros was founded by the Dorians, just like lalyssos and Lindos
  and it's located 37 km / 23 ml from Rhodes City on the west coast of the Island.
  The first signs of habitation in the wider region date back to the Mycenaean era.
  In prehistoric times the Mylantian gods (Zeus Mylantios and Himalia), who taught
  mankind milling and kneading, were worshipped here. Kamiros was gradually abandoned
  by its inhabitants and slowly buried by the earth itself with the passage of time.
  The city was built over the ruins of an older settlement after the earthquake in
  226 BC and is a characteristic example of Hellenistic urban layout and design, with
  its division into zones of public and private buildings. The ancient city was built
  on three levels, each with a distinct purpose - worship, settlement, trade.

- title: A Rural Society
  desc: Contrary to Lindos, which had a great naval tradition, Kameiros was by and
    large a rural society whose main products were olive oil, figs and wine. The need
    to export these products was the stimulus for the creation of a major ceramics
    industry. The town reached its greatest height in the 6th century B. C. which
    has been determined by the pottery that was found, in addition to the fact that
    during that same century Kameiros was the first Rhodian town to mint its own coins.
    After 408 BC (founding year of Rhodes Town) Kamiros went into decline and it vanished
    forever in the 2nd century AD.

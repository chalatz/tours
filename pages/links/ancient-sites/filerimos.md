title: Mount Filerimos - The Acropolis of Ancient Ialyssos
summary: Filerimos Mountain is located out of Rhodes Town about 14 km / 8 miles on
  the west coast of the island. In addition to the panoramic view of the Aegean Sea,
  this place is an important archaeological site. Here once stood the Acropolis of
  the Ancient Ialyssos with an important temple dedicated to Athena Polias. The hill
  took its name from a monk who came from Jerusalem in the 13th century bringing with
  him an icon of the Blessed Virgin painted by the Apostle Luke. The old monastery
  remains to be explored.

  desc: |-
    When Christianity first grew its roots in Greece (before spreading in the world), many of the ancient cult sanctuaries were transformed into churches. At that time the temple of Athena Polias was converted into an early Christian three-aisled basilica dedicated to **Virgin Mary** (Panagià, Παναγιά). The church is well known since for housing the icon of the **Virgin of Filerimos (our lady of Filerimos)**. In the 14th century under the rule of the Knights of St. John a monastery was built, surrounded by cloisters and cells and a number of chapels. There is where the miracle-working icon is so reverently kept.

    When the island came into the possession of the Ottoman Turks, the icon was taken by the Knights to France and from there to Italy, then Malta and Russia, where it stayed until the 1917 revolution. Since 2002, it has been kept in the Blue Chapel of the National Museum of Montenegro and a copy has been put in its place.

- title: Monastery of Filerimos
  desc: The monastery was destroyed during the Turkish occupation. The Italians rebuilt
    the monastery during their occupation and kept it open with monks from the Capuchin
    Order. Behind the church are the monks' cells, the walls of which are decorated
    with mosaic depictions of saints. During the war the monks returned to Italy and
    since then the monastery has been closed. The main church of the monastery was
    more like a small chapel to the Virgin Mary and young couples had romantic weddings
    there.

- title: Via Dolorosa - Way of the Cross
  desc: There is a pathway that sets off from the square that leads to the westernmost
    point of the hill. The Road to Golgotha (Via Dolorosa or Way of the Cross) used
    by the Catholics was dotted with holy icon-stands and bronze reliefs with representations
    of the Passion of Christ. Here an imposing iron Cross stood in the middle. (Today
    it’s a concrete Cross). The Via Dolorosa is the journey undertaken by Jesus, starting
    at the place where Pilate sentenced him to death and ending on Mount Golgotha
    (Calvary) and is also known as Via Crucis. Jesus walks this distance carrying
    the cross upon which he will be crucified.

summary: The ancient town of Lindos lies on the east coast of the island at a distance
  of 55 km / 34 miles from the capital of Rhodes. Some of the 15th century structures
  in the whitewashed town have been declared traditional buildings to be preserved.
  The climb to the acropolis is rewarded with spectacular views. Daily, foreigners
  and Greeks take excursions to admire this village and its acropolis, and swim at
  its marvelous beaches.    According to Homer, Lindos was built by the Dorians at
  the same time as Kameiros and Ialyssos in the 12th century B.C. Rhodes sent nine
  ships to the Trojan War and most probably they all came from Lindos. This fact shows
  that during that period Lindos was the most powerful town in Rhodes. The development
  of the town was due to its naval power. Its two harbors as well as it impregnable
  acropolis were unique on Rhodes.

- desc: There is information that Lindos already had colonies by the 7th century and
    that it monopolized a large part of trade and shipping in the Mediterranean. The
    Lindians were the first to draw up a naval code of justice, later known as the
    Rhodian Naval Code. This was to become the basis of Roman naval justice and is
    even to be found at core of modern maritime law. The Lindians were also great
    sculptors. Their bronze statues are famed for their incomparable craft. The famous
    Colossus of Rhodes was a bronze statue by the Lindian artist Chares. The town
    reached the height of its power in the 6th century B.C. particularly during the
    reign of Cleobulos who ruled for more than 40 years. Cleobulos is regarded as
    one of the Seven Sages of antiquity, primarily because he was the first to support
    the funding of public works by fund-raising drives among the citizens. The money
    from these drives was used to built the Temple of Athena in 550 B.C.

  desc: The ancient Acropolis 410 feet (160m) above Lindos. On the approach to the
    top you will come to the CASTLE, a 13th century fortress that is at the entrance
    of the site. To the left are thirteen remaining columns of the STOA which was
    constructed around 200 B.C. and has been restored. The TEMPLE of the LINDIAN ATHENA
    was once a significant religious site originally dating back to 100 BC. The remnants
    seen today were built by the tyrant Cleobulos in the 6th-century BC and are remarkably
    well intact, with colonnades flanking both sides of the temple.

title: '"La Juderia" - The Jewish Quarter'
main_id: the_jewish_quarter
summary: The Jewish Community of the Island of Rhodes has a rich history that dates
  back to the second century BC, with the earliest reference to it appearing in the
  book of Maccabees. Other references to the Jewish presence in the Island are found
  in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius. The Jews of Rhodes like
  the other Jews living in Greece and in its Islands spoke Greek and conducted the
  religious services in Greek, following the Romaniote rite, which is distinct from
  Sephardi, Ashkenaz, and Italian rites.

      caption: The Jewish Quarter
- desc: During the reign of the Knights of St. John in the 14th century, the Jews
    of the Island were relegated to the southeast section of the old city, where they
    continued to live until their deportation in 1944 to the Nazi extermination camps.
    In the year 1500, the Grand Master d'Aubusson expelled all the Jews who did not
    choose to convert to Christianity. So it seems that the Island of Rhodes was for
    a short time free of Jews, until 1522 Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottomans
    wished to repopulate the Jewish section of the Island. Thus he invited Jews from
    various parts of his empire to come to Rhodes and start a new community. The Jews
    that came were Sephardim, the ones who had found refuge in the Ottoman Empire
    following the expulsion from Spain in 1492. These Jews brought with them a vibrant
    culture filled with customs and traditions. One cultural aspect was linguistic.
    The language they spoke was Judeo-Espanol, commonly known as a "Ladino." The Jewish
    Quarter of the city was affectionately known as "La Juderia".

    At the beginning of the 20th century, many young Jews left Rhodes in search of better economic opportunities in the Americas and in parts of Africa. In the early 1920s the community reached its peak population of 4,500 souls. But the growth stopped when many more left after the enforcement of the Racial Laws by the fascist government of Italy, which had occupied the Dodecanese Islands since 1912.

    In 1943, Rhodes was taken over by the Germans. In less than a year, 1,673 members of the Jewish community were arrested and deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where 1,522 were slaughtered. Only 151 survived, many of whom immigrated to Southern African countries, Israel, the United States and other places. In 1947 the Island was ceded to Greece as part of the spoils of war. Today there are only a handful of Jews living in Rhodes. The synagogue, the homes and the cemetery are there to remind us of a thriving, close-knit community that had lived on the Island for centuries.
- title: The Square of the Martyred Jews
  id: the_martyred_jews_square
  desc: The "Square of the Martyred Jews" (known in Greek as " Evreon Martyron "),
    is located in the heart of the former Jewish Quarter. The square was originally
    an area of Jewish homes and small shops. However, the area was bombed during World
    War II, and in its place was established a small park and square. The present
    fountain ornamented with three seahorses replaced a previous fountain that was
    destroyed during World War II.

    Jewish synagogue on Rhodes used for services. There was once six synagogues in
    the Jewish Quarter (called "La Juderia"). The "Kahal Shalom" was built in the
    year 1577. The full name of the building is "Kahal Kadosh Shalom" (Holy Congregation
    of Peace). It is used for prayer services when visitors or former residents and
    their families visit the island for Friday night services, High Holiday services
    and for special occasions.

    an attorney in Los Angeles where he has been practicing immigration law since
    1980. He was inspired to visit the island of Rhodes in 1975 by stories told to
    him by his grandparents. Its special charm and history fascinated him. Several
    years later, in 1995, he came back to Rhodes with his family for his children
    to learn of their family heritage. It was during that trip that he noticed the
    need of advancin the public awareness and appreciation of its unique history unfortunately
    devastated by the Holocaust.

    in Europe and contains tombstones from the 1500's to the present and it is located
    outside the Old City of Rhodes along the main road towards Kalitheas and Faliraki.
    Excavations of additional tombstones are continuing and during the last five years
    over 300 burial stones have been uncovered.

  id: books
  desc: |-
    The "Rhodesli" are a little-known Sephardic sect who lived on the Mediterranean island of Rhodes from 1492, when they were expelled from Spain and Portugal, to World War II. Their culture, which is from 800 B.C survives as a small emigre community in Los Angeles. Their complex ethnic and religious heritage is unique in the world today. The Rhodesli are Jews who speak a rare medieval Spanish dialect (Ladino) and observe traditions derived from Turkish, Moorish, Spanish, and Jewish sources that remain mostly unchanged from centuries past.

summary: The modern town developed outside the walls of mediaeval Rhodes and throbs
  with life and activity throughout the year. It is full of surprising contrasts.
  Historic buildings rub elbows with modern blocks of flats. It is made up of wide
  streets, squares, and a multitude of shops. The architecture blends modern with
  Venetian, Gothic and Arabic elements.

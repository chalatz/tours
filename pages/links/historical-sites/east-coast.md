- desc: We set out from the town towards the southeast, along the road which runs
    parallel to the eastern coast of the island. We drive through the seaside settlements
    of Agia Marina and Reni Koskinou and on to Kalithea, known for its healing waters.
    The crystal clear waters of its lovely bay have an abundance of marine life and
    are an ideal place for diving and snorkeling.

    We continue along the coastal road, which is lined with ultra-modern tourist complexes, and we come to Faliraki.  This is one of the largest tourist settlements of the island, with a marvelous beach, many hotels, shops, sports facilities, etc...

    About 5 min drive from Faliraki and 15km from Rhodes Town is the famous "Antony Quinn Bay" a nice sand and pebble beach surrounded by green hills. It became famous before the movie "The Guns of Navarone" when Anthony Quinn fell in love of the bay and bought lands there. Since those days this place has been called Anthony Quinn Bay.

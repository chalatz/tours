summary: The Folklore Museum, which is administered by the Museum of Modern Greek
  Art, offers a glimpse into the extensive history of the island of Rhodes. The building,
  that once served as the arsenal of the Knights Hospitaller, houses collections of
  artifacts from Rhodes’ past. Exhibits include Rhodian ceramics, tapestries and needlework
  from the 17th century, and a wide range of traditional clothing and costumes with
  rich embroidery. Also included inside the museum is a reconstruction of a medieval
  home, giving visitors an idea of what life was like in Rhodes a century ago.  The
  Museum located in the Old Town "Plateia Argyrokastrou", Rhodes, Greece.

- desc: Even if ancient remains do not excite, the Museum of Decorative Arts with
    its insight into life during the past couple of hundred years, will interest all
    the family. The Museum is to be found within a building that once served as the
    Knight's arsenal and is home to an extensive array of Dodecanese artifacts and
    treasures. The Museum includes many old and hard-carved wooden furniture, along
    with brightly colored Rhodian style pottery and exquisite needlework are elegant
    reminders of an earlier culture, from the 17th century onwards.  A reconstruction
    of the interior of a traditional Rhodian house provides a good insight into everyday
    life. Many exhibits seem to originate from the island of Symi where women could
    appear well provided with rich dresses.

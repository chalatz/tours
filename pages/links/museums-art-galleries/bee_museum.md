title: The Bee Museum - Unique in Greece
summary: |-
  The Bee Museum is one of a kind and is currently open to the public in Greece. It was founded by “Melissokomiki Dodecanese” (Beekeeping Company of the Dodecanese). It showcases the rich history of beekeeping that the Greek Islands, including Rhodes, have had through the ages. The Museum receives upwards of 30,000 visitors annually.    The Museum allows you to see into the amazing world that bees inhabit through transparent observation hives. It also offers a window into the tradition and history of beekeeping in Rhodes, which used to involve stone cells, the four different types of beehives that exist, and the method by which honey is obtained, featuring every step of the beehive to table process.

  Walk through the bees’ garden and learn about the Rhodian herbs and flowers that they visit. Visit the interactive digital exhibition kiosks and play educational games. There are even souvenir shops where you can purchase natural bee products.  The museum is THE place to learn about honeybees and all of their by-products which include honey, pollen, wax, propolis, and royal jelly.

- desc: They are four different beehive types in the museum. In some Greek islands,
    as well as in Rhodes, for several reasons in the pursuit of beekeeping, stone
    cells were used.  It takes 4 kilos / 8,81 pounds of nectar to make 1 kilo / 2,20
    pound of honey. Consequently 13.000 bees must travel 177.000 km / 109.982 miles
    to collect it from 3-4 million of flowers. The queen may lay 500,000 eggs during
    her 2-3-year life span.

    Hailing originally from Ancient Greece, Melekouni is a traditional snack in Rhodes, to be offered at weddings and christenings. It is customary for friends of the bride and groom to gather before the wedding and celebrate by making this delicious treat.    It is a healthy sweet which is discerned by its great taste and high nutritional value. Aromatic Thyme honey, natural sesame, orange and lemon peel and spices, and almonds are its core ingredients.

    The sweet is considered such an integral part of Rhodes that it was registered as a **Protected Geographical Indication (PGI)** on the European Commission’s Website on **19.12.2017** “**Melekouni PGI**”.

    Honey and sesame were and remain integral to the Ancient Greek diet. Their high nutritional value was well-known even before science officially confirmed what everyone knew. The name Melekouni has roots in Ancient Greek. It is composed of Mele, meaning honey, and Kuni, meaning Kuna, the seeds in Rhodes. The word comes from the grain, which means seed in Ancient Greek.

    When compared to snacks with equal calories like biscuits, donuts, and croissants, Melekouni has the highest nutritional value of them all. It has shown to contribute to the longevity of life due to its two main components; defoliated sesame seeds and honey.

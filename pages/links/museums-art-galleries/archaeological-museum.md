title: The Archaeological Museum of Rhodes Greece
summary: The archaeological museum inside this grand historic castle gives archaeology
  and history buffs double the pleasure of discovery. The building itself is worth
  a visit, but to find a museum inside makes this stop is especially rewarding. You
  will find stacks of cannon balls and the spoils of various military campaigns on
  display along with statuary and beautiful mosaic floors.

- desc: This was the new Hospital of the Knights and their original raison d'etre
    (reason for being). Begun in 1440, over the remains of a Roman building, it was
    not until the Grand Master d'Aubusson oversaw the project for over 40 years on
    that it was completed. It was built along similar lines to Byzantine hostelries
    and is one of the few examples of Gothic architecture in Greece.

- desc: The entrance opens into a courtyard, surrounded by a galleried upper story
    accessed by an outside stairway. Stone fragments and stacks of cannonballs, relics
    from various sieges, lie on the ground.   During the Ottoman era it was used variously
    as a hospital then ignobly as a barracks. It was restored by the Italian administration
    in 1913-18 and later used to house the Rhodes Archaeological Museum.   The Museum
    contains various collections of archaeological artifacts from various parts of
    Rhodes and the neighbouring islands.

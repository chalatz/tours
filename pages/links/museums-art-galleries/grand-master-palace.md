- desc: It had very imposing dimensions (80 x 75 meters - 262 x 240 foot) and defensive
    fortifications. It was so strong that during the siege of 1522 it suffered little
    damage. The main entrance is in the south facade, flanked by two imposing towers.
    The west facade is pierced by a gate, in front of which rises a tall, square tower,
    probably the work of the Grand Master Pierre d'Aubusson (1476-1503). On the site
    where the palace stands "Castello" the "Lower Acropolis" of ancient Rhodes once
    stood. This is also where the acropolis of the Rhodians of the Byzantine period
    stood (7th century).

- desc: The arrangement of the palace around the central courtyard with the apartments
    on the first floor and the storerooms on the ground floor show the Byzantine influences
    at work. During the early years of their occupation, the Turks used it as a prison
    and then left it to crumble. The palace was completely destroyed by the great
    explosion at the church of St. John in 1856. When the Kingdom of Italy occupied
    Rhodes in 1912, the Italians rebuilt the palace as a holiday residence for Victor
    Emmanuel III of Italy , and later for Benito Mussolini. Its floors are decorated
    with marvelous mosaics of the Hellenistic and Roman period which were brought
    in from Kos Island.

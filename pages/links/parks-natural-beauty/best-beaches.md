title: Best Beaches in Rhodes
summary: |-
  Rhodes is an island surrounded by some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe. All of the beaches have free admission, but you may want to rent a sunbed or umbrella. All beaches include changing areas and showers.

  Like many European tourist resorts, topless sunbathing is allowed on most beaches. If you want absolutely no tan lines, there is a nudist beach called Mantomata, part of Falilraki Beach. Entrance to this section of the beach is achieved by showing up naked yourself. The beach is fairly remote and the water is crystal clear.

  Many beaches on Rhodes fly the Blue Flag, an international symbol of quality assurance, cleanliness, security and environmental protection of the coast and surrounding areas.

  Beaches aren't just for sunbathing. For those who love water sports, you can choose jet skiing, banana boat rides, climb onto a ringo for a fast tow behind a speedboat, paragliding, peddle boats (pedalos), bungee jumping, waterslides and sky-surfing.

  The Mediterranean Sea washes up on the east coast of Rhodes. It is the best side of the island for swimming. The Aegean Sea, which touches the west coast, tends to have stronger winds and is preferred by windsurfers.

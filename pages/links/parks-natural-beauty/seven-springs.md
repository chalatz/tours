- desc: 'Waters come out from the springs all year around, which end up in a small
    man-made lake that provides a natural habitat to tortoises, eels, crabs and a
    rare fish species called "gizani" that lives exclusively in the creeks of Rhodes
    . The whole area is surrounded by woods and offers great picturesque views. '

To get to the lake you have to walk through a very narrow dark tunnel 186 m (610 feet) long. It is nearly a five minutes' walk and it has some curves as you don't see anything at first. It takes some steps, but then you see some light again. The tunnel, constructed back in 1931 by the Italians, leads the water of the seven springs to the lake, is small, just enough for one person, therefore it's one-way only. Almost at the middle its length, there is a well used as an air-shaft and also as an "emergency exit", you will see a ladder that leads from the tunnel up to the street. There is a walking track above the tunnel which is used by some people when going to the lake.

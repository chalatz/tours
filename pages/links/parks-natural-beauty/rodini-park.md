title: The Rodini Park in Rhodes Greece
summary: The Rodini Park has the unique distinction of being the world's first landscaped
  park. This park was very popular with the Romans and they even built an aqueduct
  here. The Knights of Rhodes once grew their medicinal herbs in Rodini Park. Inside
  the park's premises, there are peacocks galore that are residents of the park. There
  is a well-defined walkway that extends all the way to the stream.   A walk of about
  10 minutes will bring you to a tomb carved into the rock. The tomb, dating from
  the Hellenist period and featuring a decoration of 21 Doric half-pillars - is known
  as the tomb of the Ptolemies.

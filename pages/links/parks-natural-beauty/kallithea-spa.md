- desc: An extensive study of the waters began in 1927, while Rhodes was under Italian
    occupation. The results of the study proved that the specific waters at Kalithea
    Bay have a range of important properties, thus the development of the area was
    proposed. The famous architech Pietro Lombardi was appointed to plan the Thermal
    Spa Institution in 1928. His plans for the Kallithea Thermal Spa were considered
    among the best architectural compositions of the time.

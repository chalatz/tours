**Dress code** in Rhodes Island is very casual, for men shorts and T-shirts is the norm, and for ladies, light summer dresses or similar to men. If you are coming in Spring or Autumn, you should bring some warmer clothes just in case it gets a bit cold in the night. Even for those who want to dress formally, smart casual is the norm, which would be a pair of trousers and a shirt.

**Internet Cafes & Free Wi-Fi.** There are many internet cafe in the Old Town, and in the New Town and the villages of Rhodes Island. There are also internet cafes open to the public at the most hotels in particular those that offer convention facilities**. **In addition, there is a number of subscription-based networks offering hotspots mainly in and around the town center. 

**Booking a Taxi.** There are strict regulations regarding the number of passengers per taxi. **Up to 4 passengers are allowed per car**, so bear this in mind when making a booking for a taxi. Make sure your luggage fits into a regular-sized car trunk, otherwise you'll have to hire a second taxi for any excessive luggage. When requesting a taxi make sure you are at the pick-up point without delay since a taxi will be there within minutes.

**Banks and ATM machines.** There are many Greek and International banks that are licensed to do business in Rhodes.

Visa, Master Card and other well-known credit cards are also accepted by most shops, and hotels. And you won't need your entire wallet only some cash, you may prefer to use ATM machines when you need cash. ATMs are everywhere. **Cash sometimes gets you a better price** than a charge card.

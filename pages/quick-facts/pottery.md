summary: Pottery was produced by the Greeks from early period. It represents an important
  record and source of analysis for understanding vary historical periods of the Greek
  ancient life. Rhodes Island is known for its tradition in pottery and ceramics,
  and there are documents stating that clay bricks from the island of Rhodes were
  used in construction of the dome of "Agia Sofia" Byzantine church in Constantinople
  . Pottery is the most common artifact found on ancient archaeological sites and
  fine examples of local work can be seen in the **Rhodes Archaeological Museum**.
  Ceramics and pottery was used by the ancient Greeks in much the same way we use
  modern kitchen containers or plastic and of course played an important role in every
  aspect of Greek ancient life such as sports, banquets, weddings and funerals.

    Although the techniques of making pottery are similar all over the Greek world, on the east side of the Aegean Sea (Eastern Greek World -- Rhodes Island ) the pottery decoration was based more on the spirals, curvilinear patterns and lively drawing. Replicas of designs produced in those times are still been manufactured today together with new modern designs in a younger generation.

    **Geometric Pottery.** From the 8th century BC, Geometric pottery decoration began to include stylized human figures, birds, and animals with nearly all the surface of the vase covered in bold lines and shapes painted in brown, black and other geometrical decoration (from whence the name of the style).

summary: |-
  The natural beauty of Rhodes alongside its magnificent Old Town and other historical monuments have always appealed to film makers. It is no surprise, therefore, that many Greek and foreign film productions, including some of Hollywood's finest were shot in Rhodes.

  We always like to watch films with our destination as a background. For all those planning to visit Rhodes, we highly recommend that they get to view some of these films and gain a taste of the unique beauty of the island. But even all those visitors who have come to Rhodes before and have adored the island, let these films be a chance for them to recall all the remarkable places they have been to. It's both exciting and fun to watch a film and be able to recognize the places it was shot in.

  desc: Although Rhodes is a relatively small island (the fourth in Greece), its location
    between East and West, close to Asia Minor, made Rhodes a crossroads of cultures

    history.  Bellow are some famous books about Rhodes, which can help the reader
    to get a clean and thorough overview of the historical and political situations
    in Rhodes through the centuries.

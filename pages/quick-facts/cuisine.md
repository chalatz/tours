title: Greek Cuisine. Greek food in Rhodes Island
summary: The island of **Rhodes can satisfy every gourmet** because it produces various
  products of excellent qualities and the local cuisine is a real delight for the
  senses.  The dishes of the Rhodian gastronomy have got definite and savory tastes.
  Most of the typical traditional Greek food of Rhodes has its roots in **the ancient
  "Dorian Rhodes"** and reflects the old traditions in most of its offerings. **"Athenaeus
  Nafkratios"** (sophist and rhetorician who lived at the end of the 2nd to early
  3rd century AD) **in his book "Deipnosofistai"** tells us that the Rhodians especially
  loved the fish soup and** praised those who "ate fish and not meat".**Later in the
  medieval and modern times, people turned more to agriculture and livestock. The
  traditional dishes based mostly on fresh vegetables, olive oil, and local herbs
  and spices, the aroma of oregano, thyme, spearmint or rosemary will inebriate you.

- title: Traditional Greek Meals and Menus in Rhodes
  desc: |-
    Traditional Rhodian Menus have three sections:

    1. **The appetizers** or starters "mezethes".

    2. **The main course** (sometimes with a side dish, this is usually vegetables or even soup) and

    3. **The Desserts.**

    The Rhodian meals may last one or two hours or even longer. Rhodians often go out for a long Sunday lunch with their families and restaurants will be lively. It's a good chance to experience Greek Rhodian culture.

- title: Ordering in a Restaurant
  desc: "When you order your meal, it would be easier if you order by section of the
    menu. First your appetizers, then the Main Course and the drinks. Dessert is ordered
    at the end of the meal.\n\nIf you wish to order **Fresh Fish \"Fresko Psari**\",
    then you ask to see the fish, and the waiter will take you to the place where
    the \"**catch of the day**\" is displayed, usually in the kitchen, or somewhere
    near the front of the restaurant. There you can inquire about what kind of fish
    is displayed, how much it **costs per kilo (2, 20 pounds)** and you order the
    quantity you want to eat. The waiters will give you the price information and
    the cooking details. The Rhodian waiters are very experienced, patient and more
    than eager to make your lunch a real pleasure (even during the high season when
    the island is packed with tourists).\n\nIf you order a **Steak \"Brizola\"** usually
    pork and beef, the waiter will ask you how you like your steak cooked. **Rare
    \"Me to ema\"** (only for the beef steak) outside is cooked, but the inside is
    still partially raw, **Medium \"Misopsimeni\"** (for pork and beef steaks) outside
    is cooked more thoroughly and the inside is cooked, but still slightly red, and **Well
    done \"Kalopsimeni\" **(for pork and beef steaks) outside is charred and the inside
    is completely cooked through.\n\n**Vegetarians.** There are sometimes one or two
    vegetarian offerings, although if they are not on the menu you can usually ask
    for a vegetarian dish.\n\n**Local wines** are part of the authentic Rhodian food
    experience. Most Rhodians drink **wine, beer, or ouzo** (a 40-proof clear alcoholic
    beverage that is flavored with anise) with their meal. There may be a house wine
    that can be ordered by the quarter, half, or full liter and will not cost much....
    The wines of Rhodes are famous for their great taste and quality since ancient
    times because the wineries and distilleries of the island produce delicious wines
    from the island's vineyards which are beneficing from the fertility of the soil
    and the constant sun.\n        "

- title: Getting the Bill
  desc: |-
    The waiter will almost never bring the bill until you ask for it. You may be the last people in the restaurant but the bill still doesn't come. When you are ready for the bill, simply ask for **"Logariasmo".** Restaurants accept credit cards 

    **Tipping** in restaurants is customary and on average is around 15% above the bill, in some establishments it is already added but not in all.
- title: Mediterranean Diet
  desc: |-
    International studies have recognized the value of the Greek cuisine. Launched in the early 60's by the World Health Organization, the Seven Countries Study set out to examine the eating patterns of people from seven different countries: Greece, Italy, Serbia, Holland, Finland, the USA and Japan. This long-running study which lasted for 30 years showed that people living in the Mediterranean countries, Greece in particular, had lower mortality rates compared to the rest of the participating countries. The "secretes" to Health and Longevity were documented as the combination of a simple diet and regular physical activity, dubbed as the Mediterranean Diet.

    **Mediterranean diet Pyramid**

    1. All plant foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, legumes, seeds, olives and olive oil, herbs and spices) are placed in a single group at the base of the Pyramid, indicating that they should be the basis of most meals.

    2. The frequency of consuming fish and shellfish is increased to at least two times per week, indicating their multiple contributions to brain and reproductive organ health.

    3. Poultry, Eggs, cheese, yogurt, moderate portions daily to weekly, and

    4. Meats and Sweets less often.

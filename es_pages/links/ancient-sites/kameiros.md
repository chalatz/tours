title: Antigua Kámiros - La Pompeya de Grecia
summary: La antigua Kámiros ha sido llamada la Pompeya de Grecia aunque es una comparación
  un tanto traída de los cabellos puesto que Pompeya, como es bien sabido, fue enterrada
  de manera dramática bajo la lava del volcán Vesubio mientras que Kámiros fue abandonada
  poco a poco por sus habitantes y luego enterrada por la tierra misma con el paso
  de los años.

- title: A Rural Society
  desc: Contrary to Lindos, which had a great naval tradition, Kameiros was by and
    large a rural society whose main products were olive oil, figs and wine. The need
    to export these products was the stimulus for the creation of a major ceramics
    industry. The town reached its greatest height in the 6th century B. C. which
    has been determined by the pottery that was found, in addition to the fact that
    during that same century Kameiros was the first Rhodian town to mint its own coins.
    After 408 BC (founding year of Rhodes Town) Kamiros went into decline and it vanished
    forever in the 2nd century AD.
- title: Louvre Museum - Paris
  desc: Many potteries and unique artifacts found during excavations on the Island

    of Denmark** and the **National Museum in Berlin**.
